# Potential DOS of deployments because Footium contracts can be initialized by anyone by backrunning the deployment transactions


## Summary

- All the Footium contracts follow the initialization method of upgradable contracts inheritance which were used for proxy pattern deployment where the `initialize` functions are called on same transactions by  calling `upgradeToAndCall`. 
- But, Footium doesn't implement proxies. So an attacker can backrun the deployment transactions to initialize with custom parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The vulnerability lies in the wrong implementation of initialize pattern. The initialize pattern of upgradable contracts are used to set the state variables in Footium contracts.
- That pattern id suited for Proxy contracts that needs initialized on deployment transaction itself.
- But the Footium contracts needs a second transaction to initialize. Which can be DOSed by attackers by backrunning the deployment transactions. So developers need to redeploy with correct initialization transactions

## Impact
DOS to deployment of Footium contracts due to Wrong implementation of initialization pattern used for proxy contracts.
All deployment (create) transactions will be backrun which will make the developers to redeploy and then it may be DOSed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Either deploy the transactions with a safe wallet, which will require a script to predict the about to be deployed contracts and the initialize calldata has to be ordered.
- Or deploy a Deployer contract that will deploy and initialize in one transaction.
- Or opt out of the initialize pattern and use constructor with immutable variables, which will save the deployment costs.
