# Zero Address Vulnerability

---
name: Zero Address Vulnerability
about: Addresses initialized with potentially zero values might lead to unexpected behavior.

## Summary

The contract initializes certain addresses with potentially zero values, which might result in unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the initialize function, the contract initializes `paymentReceiverAddress` and `footiumClub` without explicitly verifying if these addresses are non-zero.

## Impact

Assigning zero or uninitialized addresses might lead to unexpected behavior or critical errors when these addresses are accessed later in the contract's execution.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// @audit address zero
paymentReceiverAddress = _paymentReceiverAddress;
footiumClub = _footiumClub;
Tool used
Manual Review
```
## Recommendation
Ensure to validate incoming addresses to prevent assignment of uninitialized or zero addresses during contract initialization. Implement checks to ensure non-zero addresses are assigned.
