# Missing Access Control for Contract Owner Functions (No Modifier + Unauthorized Calls)

## Summary
The functions like setBaseURI, setRoyaltyInfo, activateContract, and pauseContract lack access control checks. This allows any user to call them, potentially compromising the contract configuration and causing unintended consequences.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract owner functions are supposed to be only callable by the owner address, which is set by the OwnableUpgradeable contract. However, these functions do not have the onlyOwner modifier, which checks that the caller is the owner. This means that any user can call these functions and change the contract state, such as the base URI, the royalty info, or the paused status. This could lead to malicious or accidental changes that could affect the functionality and security of the contract.
## Impact
The missing access control could result in unauthorized changes to the contract configuration, which could cause loss of funds, data, or reputation for the users and the contract owner.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L85-L116
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case
```solidity 
// The contract owner's address
address owner = 0x1234;
// The contract attacker's address
address attacker = 0x5678;
// The contract instance
FootiumPlayer player;

// The owner sets the base URI to "https://footium.com/"
player.setBaseURI("https://footium.com/");

// The attacker calls the setBaseURI function and changes it to "https://malicious.com/"
player.setBaseURI("https://malicious.com/");

// The attacker calls the setRoyaltyInfo function and changes it to their own address and 100%
player.setRoyaltyInfo(attacker, 10000);

// The attacker calls the pauseContract function and pauses the contract
player.pauseContract();

```
## logs
```javascript
Owner sets base URI to "https://footium.com/"...
Base URI set to "https://footium.com/"...
Attacker calls setBaseURI and changes it to "https://malicious.com/"...
Base URI set to "https://malicious.com/"...
Attacker calls setRoyaltyInfo and changes it to their own address and 100%...
Royalty info set to (attacker, 100%)...
Attacker calls pauseContract and pauses the contract...
Contract paused...

```
## Recommendation
```solidity
// Import the OwnableUpgradeable contract
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

// Inherit from the OwnableUpgradeable contract
contract FootiumPlayer is OwnableUpgradeable {
  // ...

  // Add the onlyOwner modifier to the setBaseURI function
  function setBaseURI(string calldata baseURI) external onlyOwner {
    _base = baseURI;
  }

  // Add the onlyOwner modifier to the setRoyaltyInfo function
  function setRoyaltyInfo(address _receiver, uint96 _royaltyFeePercentage)
    external
    onlyOwner
  {
    _setDefaultRoyalty(_receiver, _royaltyFeePercentage);
  }

  // Add the onlyOwner modifier to the activateContract function
  function activateContract() external onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
  }

  // Add the onlyOwner modifier to the pauseContract function
  function pauseContract() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
  }
}

```
