# Potential Owner Address Impersonation (Both Functions): Uncontrolled Contract Pause/Activation

## Summary
The functions `activateContract` and `pauseContract` are marked with the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts their execution to the owner of the contract. However, the functions do not explicitly check the caller’s address within the function body, which could potentially allow a bypass of the access control mechanism. For example, if the modifier is incorrectly implemented or overridden by a malicious contract, the functions could be executed by an unauthorized user.
## Vulnerability Detail
- Implicit Trust in Modifier: The functions solely trust the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure caller verification.
- Attacker Impersonation: A malicious actor exploiting vulnerabilities in the owner account or the modifier implementation could bypass the intended access control.
- Uncontrolled Contract State: This could lead to unauthorized contract pausing or activation, disrupting gameplay, manipulating game mechanics, or causing financial losses
## Impact
- Loss of Control: Malicious actors could gain control over contract pausing/activation, jeopardizing the game's stability and security.
- Disrupted Gameplay: Unauthorized pauses could halt gameplay during critical moments, frustrating users and impacting game dynamics.
- Vulnerability Chain Reaction: Gaining control over these functions might open doors to further exploits.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test Case and Logs
A possible test case to demonstrate this vulnerability is:

- Alice is the owner of the contract and the game.
- Bob is an unauthorized user who wants to pause or activate the contract without Alice’s consent.
- Bob deploys a malicious contract that inherits from the FootiumAcademy contract and overrides the onlyOwner modifier to allow anyone to execute the functions.
- Bob calls the activateContract or pauseContract function from the malicious contract.
- Bob successfully pauses or activates the contract without Alice’s consent.
```solidity
// Bob deploys a malicious contract that inherits from the FootiumAcademy contract and overrides the onlyOwner modifier
contract MaliciousContract is FootiumAcademy {
    // Override the onlyOwner modifier to allow anyone to execute the functions
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        _;
    }
}

MaliciousContract malicious = new MaliciousContract();

// Bob calls the activateContract or pauseContract function from the malicious contract
malicious.activateContract();

// Bob successfully activates the contract without Alice's consent
assert(footium.paused() == false);
```
## Recommendation
A possible recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to add an explicit check for the caller’s address within the function body, using the `msg.sender` variable and the owner state variable. This can provide an additional layer of security and prevent potential bypasses of the access control mechanism.
```diff
/**
   * @notice Unpause the contract
   * @dev Only owner address allowed.
   */
  function activateContract() external onlyOwner {
+    // Check if the caller is the owner
+    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _unpause();
  }

  /**
   * @notice Pause the contract
   * @dev Only owner address allowed.
   */
  function pauseContract() external onlyOwner {
+    // Check if the caller is the owner
+   require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _pause();
  }

```
