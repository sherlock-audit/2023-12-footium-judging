# FootiumClub does not implement ERC2981

## Summary
Footium players implement royalties while clubs do not, so marketplaces that do respect the EIP-2981 will not be paying royalties for the club NFTs which deprives developers from yield.

## Vulnerability Detail
 In the previous audit it was confirmed that clubs should implement ERC2981 Royalties which should go to the developers upon selling a club. However `FootiumClub` still does not inherit `ERC2891Upgradeable`.

```solidity
contract FootiumClub is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```


## Impact
Loss of yield for Footium developers

This is the relevant issue, for which it was confirmed clubs should implement the EIP2981 standard so that on club sale royalties will be paid to the protocol developers, yet this has not been fixed, hence it is present in the current scope.
