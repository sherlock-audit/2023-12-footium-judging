# FootiumClub is not EIP2981 compliant

## Summary

After the previous audit, protocol devs decided not to tie the players with the clubs and both of them to appear as separate entities in users’ wallets, but due to the nature of the protocol and the idea of complying with the **EIP2981** standard, all the **ERC721** contracts, both FootiumClub and FootiumPlayer should implement `ERC2981Upgradeable`:

FootiumPlayer is implementing it, but FootiumClub doesn’t: 

```solidity
contract FootiumClub is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is that **minter won’t get any royalties when clubs are being transferred**, but this is not the intention of the protocol developers as we can see from the message above.

## Impact

Loss of yield for the developers of the Footium protocol, since clubs transfers will be without any royalty applied.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement EIP2981 on clubs as well in order to be able to receive royalties.
