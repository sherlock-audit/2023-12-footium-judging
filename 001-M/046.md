# Users can bypass `Player` royalties on `EIP2981` compatible markets by selling `Clubs` as a whole.

## Summary
`Players` have a royalty built in but `Clubs` do not. This allows bulk sales of `players` via `clubs` to bypass the fee when selling players, causing a loss of yield to the developers when performing this action.
## Vulnerability Detail
You can see that [`FootiumPlayer.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol) implements the `EIP2981` standard which creates fees when buy/selling the `players`.

```solidity
contract FootiumPlayer is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
@>  ERC2981Upgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```
The issue is that [`FootiumClub.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol) on the other hand never implements this standard. This allows users to sell `player` by selling their `club` to avoid any kind of fee on `player` sales.

## Impact
Medium, as per past contest's risk rating - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/293
The developer stated this previously

> clubs should implement the EIP2981 standard so that on club sale royalties will be paid back to the protocol developers

 Loss of yield to the protocol developers.

Implement `EIP2981` in clubs as well.
