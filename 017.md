# A user who own over 2 clubs cannot distinguish that his/her players are belongs to which club.

## Summary
In this protocol, there is no any restriction that user can own only one club. However, the club and player tokens are all belongs to owner individually and there is no relation statement which represents that a player is belong to which club.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user who has over 2 clubs cannot confirm their club members clearly since there is no relation between club and player. This cause allowing every club of the user includes all players.

## Impact
A player may be duplicated in over 2 clubs and cause a conclusion on Footium management.
