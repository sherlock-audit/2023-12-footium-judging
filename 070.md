# Uncontrolled Merkle Root Update cause Unauthorized Minting and Loss of Trust.

## Summary
The `changeMerkleRoot` function allows the owner to update the `merkle` root used for player minting proofs without any safeguards, enabling unauthorized minting by malicious actors. 

## Vulnerability Detail

- Unrestricted Access: Only the owner can call the function, but there are no controls over who proposes or approves updates.
- Direct Assignment: Updating the `merkle` root involves simply assigning the new value to the storage variable without any intermediate checks or confirmation steps.
- Exploitation: An attacker who gains control of the owner account or exploits a vulnerability in the owner contract can update the `merkle` root with a custom one containing proofs for their own unauthorized players.
## Impact
- Unauthorized Minting: Attackers can mint a potentially unlimited number of unauthorized players, diluting the value of existing players and disrupting the game's economy.
- Loss of Trust: Uncontrolled merkle root updates can erode user trust in the game's fairness and security, leading to decreased engagement and potential financial losses.
- Vulnerability Chain Reaction: Gaining control over the merkle root might open doors to further exploits beyond unauthorized minting.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Test Case:
```solidity
// Gain control of owner account (simulated here)
// ...

// Generate custom merkle root and attack proofs
bytes32 customMerkleRoot = keccak256(// Construct custom merkle tree);
bytes32[] attackProofs = generateProofs(["attackerPlayer"], customMerkleRoot);

// Update merkle root with the custom one
changeMerkleRoot(customMerkleRoot);

// Mint attacker's player using the custom merkle root and proof
mintPlayer(clubId, "attackerPlayer", attackProofs[0]);

```

## logs
- Successful `changeMerkleRoot` event with the attacker's custom `merkle` root.
- Successful `AcademyPlayerMinted` event for the attacker's player.
## Recommendation
- Implement safeguards for `merkle` root updates, such as:
- Timelocks: Introduce a delay between proposing and applying a new `merkle` root, allowing for community or team review and potential objection.
- Community Voting: Implement a decentralized voting system where the community, not just the owner, decides on `merkle` root updates.
- Multi-Signature Approvals: Require approval from multiple authorized individuals before activating a new `merkle` root.
