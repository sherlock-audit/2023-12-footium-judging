# Unrestricted Merkle Root Update :: Accidental Modifications and Potential Abuse

## Summary
The function initialize sets the initial values of the `_merkleRoot` variable. However, the function does not have any modifier or conditional statement to restrict its execution to authorized users only. This means that anyone can call the initialize function and change these values, which can compromise the integrity and security of the contract and the game.
## Vulnerability Detail
- Public Function: Anyone with a wallet address can call the `changeMerkleRoot` function, not just authorized individuals.
- Unintended Updates: This allows accidental or malicious users to change the `merkle` root, potentially disrupting minting or invalidating existing player proofs.
- Abuse Potential: An attacker could exploit this access to manipulate game dynamics or gain other unintended advantages.
## Impact
- Accidental Updates: Users unfamiliar with the function might unintentionally change the merkle root, causing unexpected consequences.
- Disrupted Minting: Unauthorized updates could invalidate valid player proofs or introduce invalid ones, disrupting the minting process.
- Abuse of Game Mechanics: Malicious actors could exploit the uncontrolled access to manipulate player attributes, game statistics, or other critical data.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Test case and logs
A possible test case to demonstrate this vulnerability is:

- Alice is the owner of the contract and the game.
- Bob is an unauthorized user who wants to change the initial values of the `_merkleRoot` variable.
- Bob calls the initialize function with different value for the `_merkleRoot`  variable.
- Bob successfully changes the initial value of the `_merkleRoot`  variable.

A possible log with code for this test case is:
```solidity
// Alice deploys the contract and set the initial merkle root 
FootiumAcademy footium = new FootiumAcademy();
footium.initialize(0x123456789abcdef);

// Bob calls the initialize function with different value for the merkle root 
footium.initialize(0x987654321fedcba);

// Bob successfully changes the initial value of the merkle root 
assert(footium.merkleRoot() == 0x987654321fedcba);

```
## Recommendation
- Restrict Function Access: Change the function declaration from `public` to `internal` or implement an access control mechanism that only allows authorized roles (e.g., owner, governance contract) to call the function.
