# Audit:  Security Review: Front-Running Vulnerability in withdraw Function

## Summary
Security Review: Front-Running Vulnerability in withdraw Function

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw` function in the smart contract is susceptible to a front-running attack, potentially compromising the security of fund withdrawals. 

## Impact
This vulnerability arises from the lack of protection against adversaries attempting to exploit the time delay between transaction submission and its inclusion in a block.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L144

```
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
"Security Review: Front-Running Vulnerability in withdraw Function"

Overview:
The withdraw function in the smart contract is susceptible to a front-running attack, potentially compromising the security of fund withdrawals. This vulnerability arises from the lack of protection against adversaries attempting to exploit the time delay between transaction submission and its inclusion in a block.

Vulnerability Details:
The withdraw function allows the contract owner to withdraw the entire balance of the contract. However, the absence of safeguards against front-running could enable malicious actors to manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage. An attacker may observe a legitimate withdrawal transaction initiated by the contract owner, submit their own transaction with a higher gas price to get ahead in the queue, and effectively drain the contract balance before the owner's transaction is processed.

Proof of Concept:

solidity

// Malicious contract front-running the withdrawal
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FrontRunningAttacker {
    fallback() external payable {
        // Front-run the legitimate withdrawal
        if (gasprice > tx.gasprice) {
            withdrawContractBalance();
        }
    }

    function withdrawContractBalance() internal {
        // Perform malicious actions to drain the contract balance
        // ...
    }
}

Mitigation Steps:
To mitigate the front-running vulnerability, consider implementing a solution such as the use of a mutex or ensuring that critical state-changing operations are atomic. Additionally, introducing a withdrawal queue or using a timelock mechanism can help prevent adversaries from manipulating the order of transactions.

Recommendation:
Implement protection mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks during withdrawals.
