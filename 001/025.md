# Still a lack of royalty info for FootiumClub nfts

## Summary

`FootiumClub` lacks royalty information, in contrast to `FootiumPlayer`

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the general.md doc  : 

> The Footium prize pool system allows clubs to claim ERC20 tokens based on their league performance. Prize pools are currently funded by player trading fees but anyone can send tokens to the prize distributor contract.

but `FootiumClub` is not inheriting from `ERC2981Upgradeable` which makes a clubNFT trade not generating fees

## Impact

Marketplaces who support the `ERC2981`, wont be able to pay royalties for `FootiumClub` nfts
