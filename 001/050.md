# FootiumClub does not implement ERC2981 (a medium reported in the last audit but not fixed)

## Summary
Before everything else the credit for this finding goes to 0x52 and 0xRobocop. I gave a link to the issue in the **Code Snippet** section.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is well described by the above mentioned auditors. It was confirmed that clubs should implement ERC2981 Royalties which should go back to the developers upon selling a club. However `FootiumClub` still does not inherit `ERC2891Upgradeable`.

```solidity
contract FootiumClub is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```


## Impact
Loss of yield for Footium developers

## Code Snippet
This is the relevant issue, for which it was confirmed clubs should implement the EIP2981 standard so that on club sale royalties will be paid back to the protocol developers, yet this has not been fixed.

## Recommendation
Implement EIP2981 on clubs as well
