# Users can still bypass Player royalties on EIP2981 compatible markets by selling clubs as a whole


## Summary

Issue was originally submitted [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/293) being tagged as a "will fix" by protocol, but has not been fixed.


## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at [FootiumPlayer.sol#L16-L23](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/dae0b4b33a1634187188076e1a78ca717a250cd4/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L16-L23)

```
contract FootiumPlayer is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    ERC2981Upgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```

As seen `FootiumPlayer` implements the `EIP2981` standard which creates fees when buy/selling the players.

Now take a look at [FootiumClub.sol#L14-L20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/dae0b4b33a1634187188076e1a78ca717a250cd4/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L14-L20)

```
contract FootiumClub is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
```

Evidently, `FootiumClub` never implements this standard. 

Now from [this comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/293#issuecomment-1559800052) by the protocol developers after the submission of the original issue, we can see that it's the right functionality for the club to also implement this EIP standard. 


## Impact

Refer to this [report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/293) and it's duplicates on how this could be impactful, though the TLDR from the referenced report is that users can bypass fees on player sales by selling club instead, would be important to note that this affects **market places** too, cause the market places that support the ERC 2981, wont be able to pay royalties for any `FootiumClub` nfts.

## Recommendation

Implement EIP2981 on clubs as well.
