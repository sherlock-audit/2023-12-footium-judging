# Users can bypass Player royalties on EIP2981 compatible markets.

## Summary
`FootiumClub` lacks royalty information, makes it possible to sale players via clubs to bypass the fee when selling players.

## Vulnerability Detail

`FootiumPlayer` implements the EIP2981 standard while `FootiumClub` implements the ERC721 standard.

## Impact

There exists an inconsistency in that players NFTs implement the EIP2981 whereas that club NFTs do not, so marketplaces that do respect the EIP-2981 won't pay the royalties for the club NFTs, and this can be seen as a loss of "yield" for the developers of the footium protocol.
