# Malicious user can force Owner to waste gas

## Summary

Potential for gas wastage in the `FootiumClubMinter::mint` function due to malicious implementation of the `OnERC721Received` function in the recipient contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FootiumClubMinter::mint` function is designed to mint a club NFT and a set number of player NFTs (`INITIAL_MINT`). If the recipient (`to` address) of these NFTs is a smart contract that implements the `OnERC721Received` interface, and if this interface is implemented in a way that consumes excessive gas (e.g., through expensive computations or loops), it can significantly increase the gas cost of the `mint` transaction. This could potentially lead to the transaction failing due to exhausting the gas limit, and waste the gas spent by the contract Owner.


## Impact

Loss of funds for the contract Owner.

## Recommendation

Restrict minting to known, trusted addresses, or addresses that are not smart contracts.
