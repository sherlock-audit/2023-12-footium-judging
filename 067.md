# Redundant Initialization Function

Redundant Initialization Function
## Summary
The contract includes an initialize() function intended for initialization, but it doesn't specify any parameters or perform any setup tasks. This function doesn't seem necessary for this specific contract implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize() function in this context does not perform any particular initialization actions. It might confuse users or developers expecting some initialization logic.

## impact
While it doesn’t pose a direct security threat, it could lead to confusion or misunderstanding about the purpose of this function. It might be considered redundant without any actual functionality.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
Copy code
/**
 * @notice Initializes the Footium Token contract.
 */
function initialize() external initializer {
    __ERC20_init("Footium Token", "FOOT");

    __Ownable_init();
}
```
## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the initialize() function if it doesn’t serve a specific purpose for initialization. If intended for future updates or additional functionalities, document its purpose clearly for transparency.
