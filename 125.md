# Clients like wallets and NFT marketplaces that query to check if FootiumPlayer.sol is an ERC721 will get a false response.

## Summary
The `supportsInfterface(...)` function is commonly used by NFTmarketplace and wallets to check whether a contract supports a specific interface. And The supportsInterface function is part of the ERC-165 standard, which allows a contract to advertise which interfaces it supports. 

The FootiumPlayer.sol's `supportsInfterface(...)` will return `false` when it is checked whether supports ERC721 interface because inheritance in Solidity follows the "C3 linearization" algorithm determine the order in which parent contracts are considered when resolving a function call. 

In this case `supportsInfterface(...)` function in FootiumPlayer.sol's immediately calls the `super` keyword which means only one of the parent contracts of FootiumPlayer.sol's parent's contract's `supportsInfterface(...)` function will be called. The FootiumPlayer.sol has 3 parent(super) contracts  ERC721Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, ERC2981Upgradeable that implement this same `supportsInfterface(...)` function.

see: https://solidity-by-example.org/inheritance/

## Vulnerability Detail
The FootiumPlayer.sol inherits from ERC721Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, ERC2981Upgradeable and overrides the `supportsInfterface(...)` functions in the above parent contracts by just calling the supper of the parent contract. The issue is that due to how inheritance work in solidity and since all the above 3 parent contract have the `supportsInfterface(...)` function, The right most parent's function will be the the `super` keyword. so only the `supportsInfterface(...)` in the ERC2981Upgradeable will be called. This ignores the `supportsInfterface(...)` calls in the other 2 contracts (ERC721Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable).

The supportInterface is required by client contracts like NFTmaketplaces and Wallets to know if a contract either support ERC1155 or ERC721. 

Calling FootiumPlayer.sol's `supportsInterface(...)` function with ERC721 interfaceID returns `false` indicating that it does not support ERC721.

```
contract FootiumPlayer is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    ERC2981Upgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable
{
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        override(
            ERC721Upgradeable,
            AccessControlUpgradeable,
            ERC2981Upgradeable
        )
        returns (bool)
    {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```



## Impact
FootiumPlayer.sol can not integrate well with some NFTmarketplaces and wallets.

Most clients like wallets and NFT martkeplaces will receive `false` response when they invoke the `supportsInterface(...)` function of the FootiumPlayer.sol due to how inheritance work in solidity.

## POC
This is a simplified Solidity inheritance illustration to show that the supportsInterface(...) function of the ERC721Upgradable will never be invoked.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the support interface of the ERC721Upgradable and AccessControl Upgradeable this way:
```diff
/**
     * @dev See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.
     */
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        override(
            ERC721Upgradeable,
            AccessControlUpgradeable,
            ERC2981Upgradeable
        )
        returns (bool)
    {
--        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
++       return ERC721Upgradeable.supportsInterface(interfaceId) ||
++       AccessControlUpgradeable.supportsInterface(interfaceId) ||
++       super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```
