# FootiumPlayer::ERC721Upgradeable/Pausable Cannot pause transfers on FootiumPlayer NFT

## Summary
Pausing FootiumPlayer only pauses the calls to `safeMint` and not transfers. This means that when paused, clubs can still be traded on secondary markets such as OpenSea.

## Vulnerability Detail

Same issue as `FootiumClub::ERC721Upgradeable/Pausable Cannot pause transfers on FootiumClub NFT`, but here it applies to `FootiumPlayer`

## Impact
Pausing the NFT contract still enables transfers, and selling on secondary, so it would be inefficient in preventing the emergency situation which has led to the pausing of the contract
