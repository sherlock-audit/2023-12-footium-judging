# Players minted by `FootiumClubMinter.sol` are not tied to any playerId, only tied to the NFT's tokenId

## Summary
Player NFT's that are minted in bulk whenever a club is minted are not tied to a playerId.

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen in `FootiumAcademy.sol`, each player minted has it's tokenId linked to a playerId.

```javascript
function mintPlayer(
        uint256 clubId,
        string calldata playerId,
        bytes32[] calldata mintProof
    ) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    

        require(_mintedPlayers[playerId] == false, "Player already minted");

      
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(clubId, playerId, msg.value)));

        require(MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(mintProof, _merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof"); 

        uint256 playerAssetId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(_footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId));

        _mintedPlayers[playerId] = true;

--->  emit AcademyPlayerMinted(clubId, playerAssetId, playerId, msg.value); 
       // through the above event, playerId is linked to playerAssetId
    }
```

</details>

 However the players minted in `FootiumClubMinter.sol` to a new club are not linked to any playerId. 
 _(Note that while the variable `playerId` is used, it is used to represent the tokenId)_

 <summary> Code </summary>
 
 ```javascript
function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
        // Mint the club
        footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);

        // Mint the initial players for that club
        for (uint256 i; i < INITIAL_MINT; ) {
            uint256 playerId = footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId)
            );
            emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, to); 
--->     // the above playerId is technically the playerAssetId. not the same as playerId used in `FootiumAcademy::mintPlayer`
            // @audit - So then what about the playerId in the off-chain sense? We don't seem to be using any here.

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Since these 20 players are not linked to any playerId, it can potentially cause problems with off-chain tracking of the players.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a default playerId to link to the 20 players who are minted whenever a club is minted.
