# Lack of Access Control in FootiumPrizeDistributor's Initialization Could Lead To Loss Of ETH

## Summary

The ```initialize``` function in the ```FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol``` contract lacks access control, allowing any external malicious actor to call it and become the contract owner (```__Ownable_init()```). While front-running is not a typical concern on the Arbitrum network, the reliance on JSON-RPC nodes could introduce risk if malicious actors operate these nodes. This could result in the loss of Ether sent to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

This function ```initializes``` the Footium Prize Distributor contract.
```
function initialize() external initializer {
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __Ownable_init();
    }
```
The function does not include any access control mechanism, which allows a malicious actor to execute (front-run) the initialization process and become the owner of the contract which poses a risk of Ethers being sent to the contract lost to the attacker.

Consider the following events;
*Assume the ```initialize``` function in the FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol contract is somehow front-runned by a malicious JSON-RPC node operator and becomes the owner (```__Ownable_init()```). 

> please note that frontrunning on Arbitrum is not impossible. Arbitrum has a centralized sequencer that is fair "first to come, first to serve" which slims down the possibility of frontrunning attacks at the moment. However, most transactions are broadcasted JSON-RPC nodes from popular service providers, with eth_sendRawTransaction without directly communicating with the sequencer, which means JSON-RPC node operators could front-run transactions if they are malicious.

*In between the period whereby this attack has not been noticed, any eth sent to this compromised contract (FootiumPrizeDistributor) will be lost to the attacker. However, if noticed the admin could simply redeploy or pause any contract sending eth to this contract. 

> please note; this is a short expression of a possible sophisticated attack that could even cause more or less damage to the system. However, the possibility of this is what needs to be avoided.

Even though the contract uses OZ's transparent proxy which adopts the method that includes a call to the contract implementation initializer in the proxy's setup function i.e ensuring that steps A and B for example are taken in the same transaction so an attacker can't include a malicious transaction between these steps, this doesn't automatically solves this as the order of execution matters neither does this eliminate the need for access control in function.

## Impact

The impact of this attack is medium. While the likelihood of a successful front-running attack is reduced on the Arbitrum network, the reliance on JSON-RPC nodes introduces a potential avenue for abuse. If a malicious actor successfully becomes the owner, any Ether sent to the contract may be irretrievably lost. However, if the proxy admin notices this beforehand, the admin can simply redeploy the contract or pause any contract sending eth (e.g the FootiumAcademy), therefore the possibility of this attack is quite slim but not impossible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this, my guess is to implement access control mechanism for the initialize function. This can be achieved by either adding a modifier or a conditional statement within the function to ensure that only authorized addresses, such as a deployer or a predefined admin, can call the initialization. Alternatively, consider using OpenZeppelin's AccessControlUpgradeable to manage permissions for initialization.

For example:
```
import {AccessControlUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol";

contract FootiumPrizeDistributor is AccessControlUpgradeable {
    bytes32 public constant INITIALIZER_ROLE = keccak256("INITIALIZER_ROLE");

    modifier onlyInitializer() {
        require(hasRole(INITIALIZER_ROLE, msg.sender), "Not authorized");
        _;
    }

    function initialize() external onlyInitializer { 
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __Ownable_init();
        grantRole(INITIALIZER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
This approach ensures that only designated addresses with the appropriate role can execute the initialization.
