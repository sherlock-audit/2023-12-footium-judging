# Compromised owner can brick protocol

## Summary
Compromised owner can render the contracts unusable by pausing contracts and renouncing ownership. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The contracts `FootiumAcademy.sol`, `FootiumClub.sol`, `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol`, `FootiumPlayer.sol`, `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` implement the PausableUpgradeable and OwnableUpgradeable OZ contracts, making them pausable, and are also controlled by an owner. Majority of the important functions in these contracts are protected by the `WhenNotPaused` modifier, leaving them inaccessible when paused. 
```
    modifier whenNotPaused() {
        _requireNotPaused();
        _;
    }
```
The OwnableUpgradeable contract also includes a `renounceOwnership` function, which means at any point in time, the contract owners can renounce their ownership. 
```
    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }
```
A compromised owner account can pause the contract and renounce ownership. As a result, most of the contracts' functionalities are now unavailable, and this cannot be reversed as there's no owner.

## Impact
Bricking of protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

Override and disable the renounceOwnership() function
```solidity
 function renounceOwnership() public payable override onlyOwner {
        revert("Cannot renounce ownership");
    }
```
