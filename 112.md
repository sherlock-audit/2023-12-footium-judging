# `Auction::makePayment(...)` accepts message for even `1 wei` of value sent.

## Summary

There is no minimum limit in the `Auction::makePayment(...)` contract for the amount of ETH to be send for the new message in order to request new functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Auction::makePayment(...)` allows for sending messages even with a `1 wei` of value that is almost equal to sending nothing. Due this a club owner can send too many messages for very small amount causing too much load on the servers as the servers are responsible for getting the messages info from the emitted events. The serves might not accept to open the functionality with this small amount but a lot of message might increase load on the servers and can also cause server down. Also if there is a manual way of verifying the message then it will be a nightmare for the verifiers to do the proper verification of the correct messages.

## Impact

Club owner can increase load on servers.
