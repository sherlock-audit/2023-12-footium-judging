# Missing payable keyword on `_prizeDistributorAddress` makes it unable to recieve ETH

## Summary
The `_prizeDistributorAddress` needs to have the payable keyword to be able to receive ETH but it doesn't
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_prizeDistributorAddress` lacks the payable keyword so it won't be able to receive ETH.

```solidity
 // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: msg.value}(""); //@audit-issue no payable keyword on _prizeDistributorAddress
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value);
        }
```

## Impact
FootiumAcademy.mintPlayer() will always revert with error FailedToSendETH(msg.value) whenever the msg.value is > 0 when calling the function.
