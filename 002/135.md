# Merkle leaves are 64 bytes prior to hashing for the claimETHPrize function

## Summary
As it was stated and fixed in the previous audit, the `claimETHPrize` function in the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract is hashing 2 values with abi.encode which pads the variables to 32 bytes hence, the end result will be 64 bytes before hashing. Openzeppelin strictly states that leaves that are 64 bytes prior to hashing are vulnerable to collisions and should be avoided.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                ethMerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
        }
```
In the above code snippet, the leaf value before hashing is computed as follows: `keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))`, where "_to" represents an address (20 bytes) and "_amount" an uint256 (32 bytes). However, due to the use of abi.encode, the resulting size of the encoding operation becomes 64 bytes. This is because `abi.encode` pads the variables to 32 bytes each. 
## Impact
Tree collisions can occur. In the previous audit this finding type was considered as medium so I'll label this as medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an another variable or use `abi.encodePacked` for the `claimETHPrize` function
