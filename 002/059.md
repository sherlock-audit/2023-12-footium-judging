# Should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing when use openzeppelin merkleproof

## Summary
Per to OpenZeppelin document:
>You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value

you can find the doc here [doc ](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/utils#MerkleProof)

## Vulnerability Detail
when user invoke  [FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#claimETHPrize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L167#L175) to claim eth prize.
```solidity
  // Checks the Merkle proof, which is constructed as a hash of
  // the token address, the receiver address and the amount
  if (
      !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
          _proof,
          ethMerkleRoot,
          keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))//@audit bytes64.
      )
  ) {
      revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
  }
```
When performing `abi.encode`, if the length of `to` is `bytes20` and the length of `amount` is `bytes32`, any padding needed to make up the remaining length to `bytes32` will be added. Therefore, the total length after ABI encoding will be `bytes64`.

```solidity
  function testFuzzCheckLength(address _to,uint256 _amount) public {
      bytes memory result = abi.encode(_to,_amount);
      assert(result.length == 64);
  }
```

## Impact
the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
