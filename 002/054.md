# Merkle leaf values for `claimEthPrize` are 64 bytes before hashing which can lead to drainage of funds

## Summary

This issue is similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/300

Because Merkle leaf in `claimEthPrize` is keccak256 of 64 bytes, there can be Merkle tree collisions with internal nodes in the tree. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `claimETHPrize`, we see the following lines of code:

```
        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                ethMerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
        }
```

We take two sibling internal nodes in the Merkle tree as `_to` and `_amount`, allowing us to transfer out funds from the Prize Distributor to an address. However, the internal node representing `_amount` must be low enough for this to work (lower than the amount of funds in the contract, or low enough to the point where you can transfer in your own funds into Prize Distributor and then withdraw a higher amount). 

Because contract addresses are `hash(sender, nonce)` with CREATE, I believe that you can also do some manipulation to control the `_to` value more effectively.

## Impact

Potential drainage of funds from the Prize Distributor

## Recommendation

Don't use keccak256 of 64 bytes as leaf node
