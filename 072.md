# Minting Responsibilities Separation

## Summary

Separating the token minting functionality from the main token contract to a specialized prize distributor contract is recommended. This enhances security and ensures fair reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation allows the contract owner direct access to mint tokens, posing potential abuse or unfair distribution risks. By moving this functionality to a dedicated prize distributor contract, security and fairness can be significantly enhanced.

## Impact

Direct minting by the contract owner poses risks of arbitrary token creation, impacting token value and fairness. Segregating minting responsibilities mitigates the risk of misuse or unfair distribution, ensuring a more secure and equitable token ecosystem.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Current main token contract with minting function
contract FootiumToken is ERC20Upgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable {
    function mint(address receiver, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(receiver, amount);
    }
    // Other contract functions...
}

// Recommendation: Separate prize distributor contract
contract PrizeDistributor {
    FootiumToken public footiumToken;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress) {
        footiumToken = FootiumToken(_tokenAddress);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function distributeRewards(address receiver, uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
        footiumToken.mint(receiver, amount);
        // Additional reward distribution logic...
    }
    // Other contract functions...
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a dedicated prize distributor contract responsible for token minting and reward distribution based on predefined criteria or events. This segregation enhances security, transparency, and fairness in token distribution. Additionally, restrict minting capabilities in the main token contract to prevent potential abuse or unfairness.
