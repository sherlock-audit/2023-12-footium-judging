# `claimETHPrize` leaf can have the same length as the parents that are hashed

## Summary
The size of the leaf is the same size of the parent data that is hashed and as a result it is possible to have a hash collision between a leaf and any node in the tree. This allows for proofs to be repeated multiple times by taking subtrees as leaves.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a binary tree which has 4 leaves d,e,f,g

a->b
a->c

b->d
b->e

c->f
c->g

To calculate the parent hash for c it is `keccak(f || g)` and the parent hash for a is `keccak(b || c)` as seen in the parentHash() function below.

```solidity
    function parentHash(bytes32 a, bytes32 b) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        if (a < b) {
            return keccak256(abi.encode(a, b));
        } else {
            return keccak256(abi.encode(b, a));
        }
    }
```
A leaf is calculated in the verified by encoding the address and the amount to withdraw.

```solidity
        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,  
                ethMerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount)) //@note leaf
            )
```

`abi.encode(address, uint256)` can output 64 bytes. Since `abi.encode(bytes32,bytes32)` will be 64 bytes it is possible to have a hash collision between a leaf and a parent node.

Taking the example above if we now set `_to = keccak(e || d)` and `_amount = keccak(f || g)` and provide the proof as an empty array since we are already at `a`, the root `[]`. This proof will verify for `_to` and `_amount` set to the hash of each child node.

This issue is rated as medium as there are some drawbacks to the attack that will make it challenging to pull off in practice. The first is that `_to` is a 20 bytes address and thus will require the node in the tree to have 12 leading zero bytes which might not occur. 
## Impact
Fraudulent proofs will disrupt the claiming ETH.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider replacing `keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))` with `keccak(abi.encodePacked(_to, _amount))` in withdrawETH function as this will reduce the size of the leaf data being hashed to 52 bytes.
