# Club Owner can mint the same `playerId` string if timed correctly

## Summary

A club owner can mint the same `playerId` string twice by exploiting the timing of the minting process. This issue stems from the specific method of generating `playerId` strings.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `playerId` string is constructed using a combination of the `tokenId` (clubId), the `playerId` token counter, and the index in the initial minting sequence (`i` in the `FootiumClubMinter::mint` function). For example, a `playerId` could be "10-120-2". However, there's a timing vulnerability:

A club owner first mints a player with a specific `playerId` string using `mintPlayer`. Let's say "11-122-2".
The club owner then times the `FootiumClubMinter::mint` function call when the token counter is at a specific value (e.g., 122) to create a new club.
During the minting process of the new club (clubId = 11), when the index `i` reaches the same value as in the first minting (e.g., 2), and the token counter aligns (e.g., becomes 120), the same `playerId` (e.g., "11-122-2") gets generated again.

## Impact

This issue allows club owners to create duplicate `playerId` strings, leading to same player duplication which can impact the fairness of the game

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `FootiumAcademy::mintPlayer` checks if a playerId has been minted before `require(_mintedPlayers[playerId] == false, "Player already minted");`. It may be also require to check if a player has been minted before in the `FootiumClubMinter::mint` function and increase the tokenId or the index if that is the case.
