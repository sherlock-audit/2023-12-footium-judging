# FootiumClub NFT Seller can Honeypot Buyers

## Summary

This issue is similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/291

A FootiumClub NFT seller can honeypot buyers by making them think that there are good academy player NFTs for them to mint after they acquire the club NFT, but then frontrun and mint the academy player NFTs before the buy. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The attack path is as follows:

Requirement: You need a club NFT that has reasonably good mintable academy players

1. List the club NFT for sale
2. Someone sees it and pays a high price for it, after seeing they would be able to mint good academy players after acquiring the club
3. Seller sees the buy transaction in the mempool, and frontruns it with a mint to all the academy player NFTs associated with the club. The academy player NFTs are sent to the malicious seller's address. 
4. Buyer is left with the club NFT but cannot mint any of the valuable academy NFTs, so they have lost a good amount on their investment. 

## Impact
