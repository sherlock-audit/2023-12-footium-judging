# User can still claim Eth and erc prize after transfer

## Summary
During the erc/Eth price claiming process, owner of the token is not checked which can result in prize being claimed by user who's no longer the owner of the team/players

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to lack of check of ownership of team, previous user with proof can still claim reward
User 1 owns a club and he's eligible for reward
User 1 sells the club to user 2
User 1 can still claim prize cos owner of team is not checked 

## Impact
Previous team owner can still collect rewards. Also, Attacker can keep transferring team from wallet to wallet and keep collecting prize after getting proof for each Wallet for the same team
