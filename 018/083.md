# Opaque Contract State Changes (Both Functions): Difficulty Tracking and Analyzing Pauses/Activations.

## Summary
Both functions currently lack any mechanism to specify a reason for pausing or activating the contract. This can lead to confusion among users and hinders post-mortem analysis or understanding the context behind state changes.
## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `activateContract` and `pauseContract` do not specify a reason for pausing or activating the contract, or provide a flag to differentiate between planned maintenance and emergency shutdown. This can lead to confusion and hinder user trust, as they may not know why the contract is paused or activated, or when it will resume normal operation.
## Impact
- Reduced Transparency: Users are left guessing the motives behind contract pauses/activations, potentially eroding trust and engagement.
- Hindrance in Troubleshooting: Debugging or analyzing past events becomes difficult without proper context for state changes.
- Limited Data for Future Optimization: Lack of reasons hinders gathering data and insights for future contract improvements or governance decisions.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L77-L87
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case and logs
A possible test case to demonstrate this issue is:

- Alice is the owner of the contract and the game.
- Alice pauses the contract for a planned maintenance.
- Bob is a user who wants to mint a player.
- Bob calls the mint function and gets a revert error due to the contract being paused.
- Bob does not know why the contract is paused or when it will be activated.

A possible log with code for this test case is:
```solidity
// Alice pauses the contract for a planned maintenance
footium.pauseContract();

// Bob calls the mint function and gets a revert error due to the contract being paused
footium.mint(0xabcdef123456789, 1);

// Bob does not know why the contract is paused or when it will be activated
assert(footium.revertReason() == "Pausable: paused");
```
## Recommendation
A possible recommendation to fix this issue is to add a parameter to the `activateContract` and `pauseContract` functions that specifies the reason for pausing or activating the contract, or provides a flag to differentiate between planned maintenance and emergency shutdown. This can improve the transparency and communication of the contract and the game, and increase user trust and satisfaction.

A possible code snippet to implement this recommendation is:
```solidity
 // Define an enum for the pause reasons
 enum PauseReason { Maintenance, Emergency, Other }

 // Define a state variable to store the current pause reason
 PauseReason public pauseReason;

+ // Modify the activateContract function to accept a reason parameter
/**
   * @notice Unpause the contract
   * @dev Only owner address allowed.
   * @param reason The reason for unpausing the contract
   */
  function activateContract(string memory reason) external onlyOwner {
    // Unpause the contract
    _unpause();
    // Emit the event with the reason
    emit ActivatedContract(reason);
  }

// Modify the pauseContract function to accept a reason parameter
/**
   * @notice Pause the contract
   * @dev Only owner address allowed.
   * @param reason The reason for pausing the contract
   */
  function pauseContract(PauseReason reason) external onlyOwner {
    // Pause the contract
    _pause();
    // Set the pause reason
    pauseReason = reason;
   // Emit the event with the reason
    emit PausedContract(reason);
  }

```
