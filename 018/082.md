# Opaque Contract State Changes (Both Functions): Difficulty Tracking and Analyzing Pauses/Activations

## Summary
Both functions currently lack any mechanism to specify a reason for pausing or activating the contract. This can lead to confusion among users and hinders post-mortem analysis or understanding the context behind state changes.
## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `activateContract` and `pauseContract` rely solely on the owner of the contract to pause or activate the contract. This creates a centralized control point that is susceptible to compromise or malicious actions. For example, if the ownerâ€™s account is hacked or coerced, the attacker can pause or activate the contract at will. Alternatively, if the owner is dishonest or malicious, they can pause or activate the contract to manipulate the game or harm the users.
## Impact
- Reduced Transparency: Users are left guessing the motives behind contract pauses/activations, potentially eroding trust and engagement.
- Hindrance in Troubleshooting: Debugging or analyzing past events becomes difficult without proper context for state changes.
- Limited Data for Future Optimization: Lack of reasons hinders gathering data and insights for future contract improvements or governance decisions.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L77-L87
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case and logs
```solidity
// Bob hacks Alice's account or convinces Alice to pause or activate the contract to his advantage
footium.pauseContract();

// Bob successfully pauses the contract at will
assert(footium.paused() == true);
```
## Recommendation
A possible recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to use a decentralized mechanism to pause or activate the contract, such as community voting or multi-signature approvals. This can reduce the reliance on the owner and increase the transparency and trust of the contract and the game.
```solidity
// Import the OpenZeppelin library
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

// Use the AccessControl contract
contract FootiumAcademy is AccessControl {
    // Define a constant for the minimum quorum of votes
    uint256 constant MIN_QUORUM = 100;

    // Define a role for the voters
    bytes32 public constant VOTER_ROLE = keccak256("VOTER_ROLE");

    // Define a state variable to store the proposed pause state
    bool public proposedPauseState;

    // Define a state variable to store the number of votes for the proposal
    uint256 public votesForProposal;

    // Define a state variable to store the voters who have voted for the proposal
    mapping(address => bool) public votedForProposal;

    // Define an event for the proposal
    event ProposedPauseState(bool pauseState);

    // Define an event for the vote
    event VotedForProposal(address voter, bool vote);

    // Define an event for the execution
    event ExecutedPauseState(bool pauseState);

    // Define a modifier to check if the caller is a voter
    modifier onlyVoter() {
        require(hasRole(VOTER_ROLE, msg.sender), "Not a voter");
        _;
    }

    // Define a function to propose a new pause state
    function proposePauseState(bool pauseState) public onlyVoter {
        // Reset the proposal state
        proposedPauseState = pauseState;
        votesForProposal = 0;
        votedForProposal = {};

        // Emit the event
        emit ProposedPauseState(pauseState);
    }

    // Define a function to vote for the proposal
    function voteForProposal(bool vote) public onlyVoter {
        // Check if the voter has already voted
        require(!votedForProposal[msg.sender], "Already voted");

        // Check if the vote is in favor of the proposal
        if (vote) {
            // Increment the number of votes for the proposal
            votesForProposal++;
        }

        // Mark the voter as having voted
        votedForProposal[msg.sender] = true;

        // Emit the event
        emit VotedForProposal(msg.sender, vote);
    }

    // Define a function to execute the proposal
    function executePauseState() public onlyVoter {
        // Check if the proposal has reached the minimum quorum
        require(votesForProposal >= MIN_QUORUM, "Not enough votes");

        // Check if the proposal is to pause the contract
        if (proposedPauseState) {
            // Pause the contract
            _pause();
        } else {
            // Unpause the contract
            _unpause();
        }

        // Emit the event
        emit ExecutedPauseState(proposedPauseState);
    }
}
