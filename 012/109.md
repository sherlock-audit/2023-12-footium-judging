# Inconsistent in minting new players

## Summary
when minting new players there are different ways to do it 
## Vulnerability Detail
when creating a club for the first time, new players are created through `footiumPlayer.safeMint(footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId)`, which gets the current `tokenId` and uses it to mint a new player, however when it comes to minting new players through the academy, `_mintedPlayers[playerId]` is used to check if the player exists and also merkel proofs are used together with `footiumPlayer.safeMint` as compared to the footium player contract where the player `tokenId` is just retrieved and the player minted.
if merkel proofs are to be used in minting players it should be universal
## Impact
might create issues in tracking players in the future
