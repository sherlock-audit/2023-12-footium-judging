# Academy players can have ids clashing with club players

## Summary
Club owners can mint academy players with the same player id as the club players.
## Vulnerability Detail
Players can be minted in to a club via two the `FootiumAcademy` and the `FootiumClub` contracts. In the `FootiumAcademy` contract, minted playerids are marked as true, signifying that the player has been minted,
```solidity
        // Mint the player
        uint256 playerAssetId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
            _footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId)
        );

        // Mark the player as minted
        _mintedPlayers[playerId] = true; //@note
``` 
 and to implements a check to prevent such ids from being reminted.

```solidity
        // Ensures that the player has not been minted before
        require(_mintedPlayers[playerId] == false, "Player already minted");
```

However, in the `FootiumClub` contract, such minted playerids "0 to INITIAL_MINT - 1" are not marked as minted.
```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
        // Mint the club
        footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);

        // Mint the initial players for that club
        for (uint256 i; i < INITIAL_MINT; ) {
            uint256 playerId = footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId)
            );
            emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, to);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
```
This allows club owners can mint players of the same id ("0 to INITIAL_MINT - 1")in the academy, since it will bypass the id check in the `FootiumAcademy` contract. Also, not that this can be done at no cost as there's no check for msg.value != 0.

## Impact
Id clash, bypassing protocol check.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `_mintedPlayers` mapping in the `FootiumClub` contract and set the status of playerid minted from there to true.
