# inclusion of claimable addresses in Merkle leaf hashes


---
name: Claimable Address in Leaf Hashes
about: inclusion of claimable addresses in Merkle leaf hashes
title: Claimable Address in Leaf Hashes
labels: Vulnerability, Merkle Tree
assignees: ""

## Summary
The claimable address (for ERC20 prizes) is not explicitly included in the leaf hash.

## Vulnerability Detail
Absence of the claimable address within leaf hashes can potentially expose the contract to vulnerabilities related to claimable addresses.

## Impact
Possible security risks due to missing claimable addresses within the leaf hashes of the Merkle tree, potentially affecting the security of prize distribution.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(
    // ... existing parameters ...
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Ensure claimable address is included in the leaf hash
    require(keccak256(abi.encode(_token, _to, _amount, _claimableAddress)) == <computedLeafHash>, "Claimable address missing in leaf hash");

    // ... existing code ...
}

```
Replace <computedLeafHash> with the computed value of the leaf hash including the claimable address.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the leaf hash construction to include claimable addresses if required for the specific use case to enhance security.
