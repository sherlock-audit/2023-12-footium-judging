# _mint() used instead of _safeMint()

## Summary
Used _mint() which can mint tokens to the address that does not support ERC721 token, which will result in financial loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. 
Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

## Impact
Medium

If the recipient is a contract, safeMint() checks whether they can handle ERC721 tokens.

## Code Snippet
contracts/FootiumToken.sol#23

```javascript
function mint(address receiver, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(receiver, amount);
    }
```
If the user provides an address that can't handle ERC721 tokens when calling mint() the minted token might be lost. 
That would also result in the user not being able to redeem the token anymore.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint() instead _mint() this will ensure that tokens are minted to the supported address
