# Emission of event with wrong value

## Summary
InitialPlayerMinted  event emitted in FootiumClubMinter contract with name playerId is not actual playerId of the player.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L20-L25
event InitialPlayerMinted(
        uint256 indexed clubId,
        uint256 indexed index,
        uint256 playerId,
        address owner
    );
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L74-L78
 Here, event emitted with value playerId is counter value instead of actual playerId which is a string type value.

## Impact
As playerId is generated offchain and is a string value combination of clubId, mint season and index and also most of the logic is offchain and may be dependent on these emitted values so In order to avoid any confusion, right values with right names must be emitted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
instead of uint256 playerId some other name like uint256 counter can be used.
