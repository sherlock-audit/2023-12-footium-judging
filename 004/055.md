# InitialPlayerMinted event is potentially incorrect

## Summary

The InitialPlayerMinted event is potentially incorrect, which can lead to issues with off chain processing. 
## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the mint code in FootiumClubMinter:

```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
        // Mint the club
        footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);

        // Mint the initial players for that club
        for (uint256 i; i < INITIAL_MINT; ) {
            uint256 playerId = footiumPlayer.safeMint(
                footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId)
            );
            emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, to);

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Notice that the initial players are minted to `footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId)`, while the `InitialPlayerMinted` event uses `to`. Notice that these can actually be different, because after `footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);`, the club NFT can be transferred in `onERC721Received`. The event is therefore wrong, and can lead to errors with off chain processing. 

## Impact

Emitted event is wrong, and can lead to issues with off chain processing.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, to);` to `emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId));`
