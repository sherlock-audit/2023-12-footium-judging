# No check for `paymentReceiver == address(0)` can result in lost funds

## Summary
Inside [FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L20C20-L20C42) there is a storage variable responsible for receiving [payments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L101). But there are no validation whether it has already been initialised and if the provided address is valid. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract is upgradable, which means that `initialize` function should be called and used as a constructor and prior to this call the contract is available and functional and everybody can call it's functions. Which is a problem when there are payment functions. Those functions never check whether the contract has already been initialised. Another problem here is that [`setPaymentReceiverAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L52)  never check if the provided argument is a valid address (!= address(0)), which is best practice and is easily implemented.
## Impact
Lost of funds for protocol in case of payment to address(0)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for contract being initiallized and for address(0) when setting `paymentReceiverAddress`:
```diff
    function initialize(
        address _paymentReceiverAddress,
        IFootiumClub _footiumClub
    ) external initializer {
+        require(_paymentReceiverAddress != address(0)
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __Ownable_init();

        paymentReceiverAddress = _paymentReceiverAddress;
        footiumClub = _footiumClub;
    }
```

```diff
    function setPaymentReceiverAddress(address _paymentReceiverAddress)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
+       require(_paymentReceiverAddress != address(0)
        paymentReceiverAddress = _paymentReceiverAddress;

        emit PaymentReceiverUpdated(paymentReceiverAddress);
    }
```
