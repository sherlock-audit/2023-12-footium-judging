# FootiumPlayer::ERC721Upgradeable/Pausable Cannot pause transfers on FootiumPlayer NFT

## Summary
Pausing FootiumPlayer only pauses the calls to `safeMint` and not transfers. This means that when paused, clubs can still be traded on secondary markets such as OpenSea.

## Vulnerability Detail

Same issue as `FootiumClub::ERC721Upgradeable/Pausable Cannot pause transfers on FootiumClub NFT`, but here it applies to `FootiumPlayer`

## Impact
Pausing the NFT contract still enables transfers, and selling on secondary. 

As seen in recent events such as here:

A non operating pausing feature will prevent the team to react accordingly following a hack, and may cause loss of NFTs to users of the protocol

## Recommendation
FootiumPlayer should inherit ERC721PausableUpgradeable class of openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable
