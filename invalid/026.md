# Limitations in Smart Contract Interaction within Footium Ecosystem

## Summary
It's possible to mint an NFT to a smart contract in an easy way on the whole system, however `FootiumAcademy`, `FootiumPrizeDistributor`, and `FootiumGeneralPaymentContract` contracts require certain actions to be performed by the owners of various entities (like clubs), but do not account for scenarios where these owners are smart contracts lacking the necessary functions to interact with core Footium contracts.

The minting process should ensure that full functions from footium ecosystem are handled by smart contract minter

## Vulnerability Detail
1. FootiumAcademy:
Function: `mintPlayer()`
Code Snippet:
```solidity
if (msg.sender != _footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId)) { 
    revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender); 
}
```
**Issue**: If the owner of clubId is a smart contract without a function to call `mintPlayer`, it cannot mint players.

2. FootiumPrizeDistributor:
Function: `claimERC20Prize()`, `claimETHPrize()`

```solidity
if (_to != msg.sender) { 
    revert InvalidAccount();
}
```
**Issue**: If `_to` is a smart contract that cannot call these functions, it cannot claim prizes.

3. FootiumGeneralPaymentContract:
Function: `makePayment()`

```solidity
if (msg.sender != footiumClub.ownerOf(_clubId)) { 
    revert NotClubOwner(_clubId, msg.sender); 
}
```
**Issue**: If the owner of `_clubId` is a smart contract without functionality to call `makePayment`, it cannot make payments.

## Impact
 Prevents ability of smart contract-owned clubs to participate fully in the Footium ecosystem

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If minter is a smart contract add some checks to ensure that these functions are present on the smart contract
