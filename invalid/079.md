# Potential Reentrancy Attack in FootiumAcademy Contract

## Summary
This report identifies a potential reentrancy attack vulnerability within the FootiumAcademy smart contract. Our analysis focuses on the mintPlayer function, which contains a pattern of external calls that could be exploited. Despite the use of ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, the contract's current implementation may not fully safeguard against sophisticated reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The identified vulnerability lies in the mintPlayer function of the FootiumAcademy smart contract, specifically in the use of a low-level call for transferring Ether. The function allows a user to mint a new football player NFT and then sends Ether to another contract (_prizeDistributorAddress) as part of the minting process.

## Impact
Loss of Funds: The most direct and severe impact of a reentrancy attack is the unauthorized withdrawal or redirection of funds. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to drain Ether from the contract, potentially stealing Ether sent by other users for minting players.
Denial of Service (DoS): Reentrancy can also lead to a denial of service. If an attacker disrupts the contract's state (e.g., by causing a function to revert after partial execution), it could prevent legitimate operations, like minting or transferring NFTs.
Manipulation of Contract State: Reentrancy attacks may lead to unexpected changes in contract state, such as duplicating NFTs or corrupting ownership records, undermining the integrity of the game.
Damage to User Trust and Project Reputation: Exploitation of such a vulnerability could lead to significant reputational damage and loss of user trust, which is often more challenging to recover from than financial loss.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L134

```solidity
function mintPlayer(
    uint256 clubId,
    string calldata playerId,
    bytes32[] calldata mintProof
) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // [Omitted: Validation and state change logic]
    // Forwarding total fee to the prize distributor contract
    (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: msg.value}("");
    if (!sent) {
        revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value);
    }
}
```

Manually review
Mechanism of Vulnerability:
The use of .call{value: msg.value}("") to send Ether is a low-level operation that can execute arbitrary code in the recipient contract. This exposes the FootiumAcademy contract to potential reentrancy attacks, where the called contract could re-enter the mintPlayer function or other functions of FootiumAcademy before the initial execution is complete.

Security Guard Utilized:
The function is guarded by the nonReentrant modifier from ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, intended to prevent reentrancy attacks. However, this guard is not infallible, especially against more complex attack vectors. 

## Recommendation
Replace call with Safer Methods: Substitute the call method with transfer or send. Even better, use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeTransfer library, offering improved security for Ether transfers.

Reorder Event Emission: Emit the AcademyPlayerMinted event before the external call to align with best practices.

Enhanced Testing and Auditing: Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases focused on reentrancy. An external audit is recommended to ensure all potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.

Implement Withdrawal Pattern: Consider adopting a pull-over-push payment mechanism to reduce risks associated with direct Ether transfers in smart contracts.
