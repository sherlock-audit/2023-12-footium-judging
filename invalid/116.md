# Role Confusion in Contract Ownership and Access Control (Overlapping Contracts + Ambiguous Permissions)

## Summary
The contract uses the OwnableUpgradeable and AccessControlUpgradeable contracts from the OpenZeppelin library, but they have some overlapping functionalities. For example, both contracts have a DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE that grants full control over the contract. This could lead to confusion and potential security issues.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract inherits from both the OwnableUpgradeable and AccessControlUpgradeable contracts, which are used to manage the ownership and access control of the contract. However, these contracts have some overlapping functionalities and roles, which could create confusion and ambiguity. For example, both contracts have a DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, which is assigned to the contract deployer and grants full control over the contract. This means that there are two different ways to grant or revoke permissions, change roles, or transfer ownership. Moreover, the contract does not specify who has which role and what permissions they have, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse of the contract.
## Impact
The role confusion could result in a lack of clarity and accountability for the contract, as well as potential security issues. For example, an attacker could exploit the ambiguity of the roles to gain access to the contract or perform malicious actions. Alternatively, a legitimate user could accidentally perform an action that they are not supposed to, or lose access to the contract due to a role change.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test Case
```solidity
// The contract deployer's address
address deployer = 0x1234;
// The contract owner's address
address owner = 0x5678;
// The contract minter's address
address minter = 0x9ABC;
// The contract instance
FootiumClub club;

// The deployer calls the initialize function and sets the base URI
club.initialize("https://footium.com/");

// The deployer transfers the ownership to the owner
club.transferOwnership(owner);

// The owner grants the minter role to the minter
club.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, minter);

// The minter mints a new NFT to the owner
club.safeMint(owner, 1);

// The deployer revokes the minter role from the minter
club.revokeRole(MINTER_ROLE, minter);

// The minter can no longer mint new NFTs
club.safeMint(owner, 2); // Reverts

// The deployer grants the minter role to themselves
club.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, deployer);

// The deployer can mint new NFTs
club.safeMint(owner, 3);

// The owner renounces the default admin role
club.renounceRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, owner);

// The owner can no longer grant or revoke roles
club.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, minter); // Reverts

// The deployer still has the default admin role
club.hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, deployer); // Returns true

```

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, you can consider using only one of the contracts, either OwnableUpgradeable or AccessControlUpgradeable, to manage the ownership and access control of the contract. Alternatively, you can make it clear who has which role and what permissions they have, and avoid granting the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to multiple accounts.
```solidity
// Use only the AccessControlUpgradeable contract to manage the roles and permissions
contract FootiumClub is
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
  // Define a custom role for the contract owner
  bytes32 public constant OWNER_ROLE = keccak256("OWNER_ROLE");

  // ...

  function initialize(string memory baseURI) external initializer {
    __ERC721_init("FootiumClub", "FFC");
    __AccessControl_init();
    __Pausable_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();

    _base = baseURI;
    // Grant the owner role and the default admin role to the deployer
    _setupRole(OWNER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
  }

  // ...

  // Override the transferOwnership function to use the owner role
  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual override {
    require(hasRole(OWNER_ROLE, msg.sender), "FootiumClub: caller is not the owner");
    require(newOwner != address(0), "FootiumClub: new owner is the zero address");
    // Grant the owner role and the default admin role to the new owner
    _setupRole(OWNER_ROLE, newOwner);
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, newOwner);
    // Renounce the owner role and the default admin role from the current owner
    renounceRole(OWNER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    renounceRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, newOwner);
  }

  // ...
}

```
