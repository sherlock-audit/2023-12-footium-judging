# Absense of Sweeper function in FootiumPrizeDistributor to wihdraw unclaimed prize tokens and Ether.

## Summary
`FootiumPrizeDistributor` contracts lacks the functionality to sweep the unclaimed ether and tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contracts allows to claim prize tokens and ether via merkle proof verification system.
- But if the recipient did not claim for a long time, which will result in lost value of ether and tokens.
- However it can be sweeped with setting a new merkle root that allows the owner to claim those unclaimed tokens or ether.
- But it that transactions looks like rug pull the tokens out.
- But implementing the sweeper functions shows the transparency of that transaction.

## Impact
Lost tokens and ether if prizes are unclaimed

- Implement a sweeper function that sweeps if the prizes are not claimed for more than 3 months.
- Or use push over pull pattern to distribute the prizes.
