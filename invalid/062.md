## Summary

The `FootiumClubMinter` contract allows for the minting of Footium clubs and their initial players. However, a potential vulnerability exists in the minting loop for initial players.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Uncontrolled Loop**: The minting loop for initial players lacks a clear condition for loop termination, leading to potential gas consumption issues.

## Impact

The uncontrolled loop in the minting function could cause excessive gas consumption or even contract execution failure in scenarios where the loop iteration count exceeds safe gas limits.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Vulnerable loop without a clear condition for termination
for (uint256 i; i < INITIAL_MINT; ) {
    uint256 playerId = footiumPlayer.safeMint(footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId));
    emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, to);

    unchecked {
        i++;
    }
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's crucial to implement a clear termination condition for the minting loop to prevent uncontrolled gas consumption and potential contract failure.
