# Possible cross-function/contract/protocol/chain reentrancy

## Summary

Not following best practices increase risk of reentrancy.

## Vulnerability Detail

FootiumAcademy.sol contract has function for minting players `mintPlayer` this function doesn't follow CEI(Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern. 

```javascript
// @audit-issue not following CEI
        // Mint the player
@>      uint256 playerAssetId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(
            _footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId)
        );

        // Mark the player as minted
@>      _mintedPlayers[playerId] = true;
```
As you can see here function mint player then mark the player as minted.

## Impact

Usually, I always recommend following the CEI pattern even if there is a nonReentrant modifier in place. Because cross-function/contract/protocol/chain reentrancy can happen, the modifier won't be any help in this situation.

            _footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId)
        );

-        _mintedPlayers[playerId] = true;
