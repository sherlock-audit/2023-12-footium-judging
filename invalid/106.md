# FootiumAcademy.withdraw function will never  be used


## Summary
`FootiumAcademy.withdraw` function transfers contract available ether balance to the contact owner address.
But there will be no ether ever to transfer, because the contract doesn't accept ether at all.

## Vulnerability Detail
- `FootiumAcademy.withdraw` will transafer the ether in the contract to the owner, but the contract has no way to except the ether except for `mintPlayer` function which will transfer all the ether to `_prizeDistributorAddress` it receives on the same transaction.
- So there's no way the `FootiumAcademy` has ether to transfer because it lacks `receive` & `fallback` functions except by force sending by destroying some other contract.
- So if withdraw function was implemented for that case, then it should have been implemented for all the contracts of Footium system.

## Impact
Implementation of a function that will never be used.
