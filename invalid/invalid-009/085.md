# User cannot claim all standing rewards

## Summary
Inside `FootiumPrizeDistributor` there is a functions to claim prizes in [ETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L109), or [ERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L155). The problem is related to the essence of how Mertkle leafs and roots work and the custom logic regarding calculation what value to send to the user:
```solidity
        // The amount to be claimed is the difference between the total amount
        // and the amount already claimed.
        // This means that the amount passed in the function call is the total
        // amount that was ever earned by the user.
        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];
```
## Vulnerability Detail
We have a merkle root, which is used to verify whether provided values and proof match the provided root. If we want to summarize an example of what is a valid leaf inside a merkle tree we can provide the following structure:
![image](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium-NicolaMirchev/assets/78795830/2a1203b7-ee6e-43d9-b403-9a0d74f6f364)
- We have leaves storing information about different users deserved prices (amount, token & user address)
- We can have a leaves storing information for deserved prizes for the same user, but with different amounts
- We can generate a valid merkle proof hashing all infomation stored in a leaf (amount, user address, token address) for a given tree and proof that the leaf exist. 
In the contract we [verify](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L168) this proof agains a root of the merle saved in storage. 
- Valid proofs are those, which corresponds to existing leafs. If we have 2 leafs for the same user & token as it is in the diagram above user has pending rewards of 225 tokens in total, but if he try to make a proof for an amount of 225 it won't be valid, because the is no such leaf.
- User has to make proofs for both rewards and call function to claim rewards two times with different proof.
But lets see how initial safety check could cut user rewards:
```solidity
       uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];

        // If there is still an amount to be claimed, transfer the tokens
        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;
```
- If user first claims his larger reward of 150 tokens `totalETHClaimed[_to]` will be set to 150
- In following transaction trying to claim another valid reward with valid proof for 75 the following line will revert:
` uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to] = 75 - 150`, which result in unclaimable reward for user
- Even if the order of transaction is reversed, again the user won't be able to claim all 225 tokens, but just 150, because 
- - First tx: claim 75: totalETHClaimed[_to] = 75
- - Second tx: claim 75, because _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to] = 150 - 75 = 75

`test/FootiumPrizeDistributor.test.ts`
In the comment of the gist I have provided info about additional setup of the base test.
## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would suggest to remove the check and provide another mechanism for claiming rewards, so one proof cannot be used multiple times.
