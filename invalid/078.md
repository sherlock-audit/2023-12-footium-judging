# Unvalidated Merkle Root Input cause Potential Crashes and Unexpected Behavior

## Summary
This report identifies and explains an issue of lack of input validation in the code snippet that you have shared with me. The code snippet is a function that changes the `_merkleRoot` storage variable in the `FootiumAcademy` smart contract, which is part of the `Footium` game.
## Vulnerability Detail
- The function `changeMerkleRoot` accepts a bytes32 `merkleRoot` parameter without any validation. The `merkle` root is a hash that represents the root of a Merkle tree, which is a data structure that allows efficient and secure verification of the integrity of data. The `merkle` root is used by the contract to verify the ownership of players that can be minted by users. Therefore, it is crucial that the `merkle` root is valid and consistent.

- However, the function does not check if the input has the correct format or length, or if it is consistent with the previous `merkle` root. This could potentially lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the input is invalid. For example, if the input is too short or too long, or if it contains invalid characters or format. Invalid or unexpected inputs could also result in fake proofs and unauthorized minting of players.

- An attacker could exploit this by feeding in malicious or malformed input to disrupt the contractâ€™s operation. This could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, where the contract is temporarily disabled or consumes excessive resources.
## Impact
It can affect the stability and functionality of the contract and the game. It can also cause errors or inconsistencies in the data verification and minting processes. It can also damage the reputation and trust of the contract and the game among the users and the community.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L68-L71
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case and logs
A possible test case to demonstrate this vulnerability is:

- Alice is the owner of the contract and the game.
- Bob is an attacker who wants to crash the contract or cause unexpected behavior.
- Bob calls the changeMerkleRoot function with an invalid input for the merkleRoot parameter.
- Bob causes the contract to crash or behave unexpectedly.

A possible log with code for this test case is:
```solidity
// Alice deploys the contract and sets the initial merkle root 
FootiumAcademy footium = new FootiumAcademy();
footium.initialize(0x123456789abcdef);

// Bob calls the changeMerkleRoot function with an invalid input for the merkle root
footium.changeMerkleRoot("Hello World");

// Bob causes the contract to crash or behave unexpectedly
assert(footium.merkleRoot() == "Hello World"); // This will fail because the input is not a valid bytes32

```
## Recommendation
A possible recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to add some checks to ensure the merkle root is correctly formatted and has the expected length. For example, you can use the require function to validate the input and revert the transaction if the input is invalid. You can also use the bytes32ToString function from OpenZeppelin to convert the input to a string and compare it with a regular expression that matches the expected format of the merkle root.

You should also implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs and prevent crashes. For example, you can use the try/catch statements to catch and handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the function.

Additionally, you should consider using SafeMath libraries when performing calculations involving the merkle root, to prevent integer overflows and underflows that may result in incorrect or inconsistent values.
```solidity
// Import the OpenZeppelin library
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

// Use the Strings and SafeMath libraries
using Strings for bytes32;
using SafeMath for uint256;

// Define a constant for the expected length of the merkle root
uint256 constant MERKLE_ROOT_LENGTH = 32;

// Define a constant for the regular expression that matches the expected format of the merkle root
string constant MERKLE_ROOT_REGEX = "^[0-9a-fA-F]{64}$";

// Modify the changeMerkleRoot function to validate the input and handle errors
function changeMerkleRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot) public onlyOwner {
    // Try to execute the function
    try {
        // Check if the input has the expected length
        require(merkleRoot.length == MERKLE_ROOT_LENGTH, "Invalid length");
        // Convert the input to a string
        string memory merkleRootString = merkleRoot.bytes32ToString();
        // Check if the input matches the expected format
        require(merkleRootString.matches(MERKLE_ROOT_REGEX), "Invalid format");
        // Check if the input is consistent with the previous merkle root
        require(merkleRoot != _merkleRoot, "No change");
        // Update the merkle root using SafeMath
        _merkleRoot = merkleRoot.add(1);
        // Emit the event
        emit ChangedMerkleRoot(_merkleRoot);
    // Catch any errors
    } catch Error(string memory reason) {
        // Handle the error
        emit ChangeMerkleRootFailed(reason);
    }
}
