## Summary
The contract does not emit an event upon successful withdrawal of funds, reducing transparency in fund movement tracking.

## Vulnerability Detail
Absence of an event emission after a successful withdrawal in the withdraw function makes it challenging to track and verify fund movements, reducing contract transparency.

## Impact
Lack of event emission might lead to difficulties in auditing or monitoring the contract's fund movements, reducing transparency and accountability.

## Code Snippet
solidity
Copy code
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
    //...existing code...

    // Example of missing event emission:
    (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
    if (!sent) {
        revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
    }
    // Missing event emission after successful withdrawal
}
## Tool used
## Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include an event emission after a successful withdrawal to provide transparency and facilitate auditing of fund movements within the contract.
