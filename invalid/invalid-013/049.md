# Audit: Events Should be emmited After a Change in State

## Summary
In Ethereum smart contract development, the proper emission of events is crucial for communicating state changes to external entities. This guide outlines best practices for emitting events after state changes to enhance transparency, auditability, and integration capabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail
This guide outlines best practices for emitting events after state changes to enhance transparency, auditability, and integration capabilities.

## Impact
Emitting events after state changes provides a structured approach to notifying external applications and users about modifications to the contract's state. This practice improves user experience and facilitates seamless integration with decentralized applications.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L144

```solidity
 function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
            // @audit-info after a change in state there should be an emit statement...
        }
    }
```

```solidity
 function setPlayerAddress(IFootiumPlayer _footiumPlayer)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        footiumPlayer = _footiumPlayer;
        // @audit-info emit after state change
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClubMinter.sol#L59

```solidity
  function setClubAddress(IFootiumClub _footiumClub) external onlyOwner {
        footiumClub = _footiumClub;
      // @audit-info emit after state change
    }
```
