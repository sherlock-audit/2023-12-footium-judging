# FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol and FootiumAcademy.sol do not implement update function for footiumClub & footiumPlayer variables as can be found in FootiumClubMinter.sol

## Summary
FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol does not implement update function for footiumClub variable as can be found in FootiumClubMinter.sol which is incredibly important for updating the address if new contracts were to be deployed.

Same can be said for FootiumAcademy.sol - this contract does not have update function for footiumPlayer and footiumClub variables. 

For example, FootiumClubMinter.sol implements update function for footiumClub variable

## Vulnerability Detail

Missing update functions on two contracts (FootiumAcademy.sol and FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol)

## Impact

New FootiumClub contract can be deployed for whatever reason and its' address can not be updated on two contracts. Sure, we can deploy new ones but transferring their state is tricky and prone to vulnerability.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement functions for updating these addresses on said contracts.
