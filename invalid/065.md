# detection of duplicate proofs in Merkle trees


---
name: Detection of Duplicate Proofs
about: Audit item regarding detection of duplicate proofs in Merkle trees
title: Detection of Duplicate Proofs
labels: Vulnerability, Merkle Tree
assignees: ""

## Summary
The contract does not prevent the use of duplicate proofs within the Merkle tree.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of checks to prevent the reuse of previously claimed proofs (`claimETHPrize` and `claimERC20Prize`) can lead to potential double-spending or vulnerabilities.

## Impact
Risk of exploitation due to the absence of checks for duplicate proofs within the Merkle tree, potentially resulting in double-spending or other vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) private usedProofs;

function claimETHPrize(
    // ... existing parameters ...
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Check if the proof has been used before
    require(!usedProofs[keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))], "Duplicate proof detected");
    
    // Mark the proof as used
    usedProofs[keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))] = true;

    // ... existing code ...
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the verification process to detect and reject duplicate proofs during claim operations.
