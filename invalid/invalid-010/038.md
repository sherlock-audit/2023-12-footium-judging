# Blocked accounts can not claim their prizes

## Summary
According to protocol's contest page, any ERC20 token will be used in the protocol. Some ERC20 tokens like USDC has a block/blacklist functionality. If these tokens are used as prize token, blocked accounts no way to claim their prizes.

## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see below, only the prize recipient can call the `claimERC20Prize()` function, and the prize is transferred to the caller.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L116C5-L118C10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L116C5-L118C10)

```solidity
    function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the prize receiver is the sender
-->     if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }

        // ... some code

        // If there is still an amount to be claimed, transfer the tokens
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
-->         _token.safeTransfer(_to, value);
        }

        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
```

According to the [contest page](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/131), any ERC20 tokens will be used in this protocol. If the ERC20 token used for prizes has a blocklist functionality like USDC and the user is blocked at the contract level, there is no way for that user to claim their prizes.

The prize recipients should be able to provide another address to be able to claim their rights.

**Scenario:**

* Bob plays the Footium game and his club earns USDC prize.
    
* Bob's account gets blocklisted in USDC after the league is finished but before he claimed his prize.
    
* He tries to claim but the transaction fails.
    
* He has no other way to claim.
    

**Note**: I am submitting this issue just because the contest page shows any token will be used in the protocol. This issue is invalid if the [FootiumToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumToken.sol) is the only token that will be used as the prize token.

## Impact

- Blocklisted accounts can not claim their earned prizes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend adding another parameter to the claim function. All the checks should be made against the prize owner like before, but the transfer should be made to the provided secondary address.

```diff
function claimERC20Prize(
-       address _to,
+       address _prizeOwner
+       address _transferTo
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the prize receiver is the sender
-       if (_to != msg.sender) {
+       if (_prizeOwner != msg.sender) {     
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }

        // Checks the Merkle proof, which is constructed as a hash of
        // the token address, the receiver address and the amount
        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                erc20MerkleRoot,
-               keccak256(abi.encode(_token, _to, _amount))
+               keccak256(abi.encode(_token, _prizeOwner, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidERC20MerkleProof();
        }

        // The amount to be claimed is the difference between the total amount
        // and the amount already claimed.
        // This means that the amount passed in the function call is the total
        // amount that was ever earned by the user.
-       uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];
+       uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_prizeOwner];

        // If there is still an amount to be claimed, transfer the tokens
        if (value > 0) {
-           totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
+           totalERC20Claimed[_token][_prizeOwner] += value;
-           _token.safeTransfer(_to, value);
+           _token.safeTransfer(_transferTo, value);
        }

-        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
+        // This event must be changed too.
+        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _prizeOwner, _transferTo, value);
    }
