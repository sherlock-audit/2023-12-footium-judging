# Minting to Wrong Club :: Unauthorized Player Allocation

## Summary
The function relies on the external `_footiumClub.ownerOf` function to verify club ownership before minting a player. This poses a potential security risk if that function is compromised or vulnerable to manipulation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `mintPlayer` checks if the caller owns the club to which the player is being minted, using the external `_footiumClub.ownerOf` function. However, this function may not be reliable or secure, as it depends on another contract that may be compromised or vulnerable to manipulation. For example, if the `_footiumClub` contract has a bug or a malicious owner, the `ownerOf` function may return incorrect or inconsistent values, allowing an attacker to mint players to a wrong club even if they don’t own it.
## Impact
It can allow unauthorized users to mint players to a wrong club without the owner’s consent. This can compromise the integrity and security of the contract and the game, and cause loss of funds or reputation for the owner and the users.
- Players Minted to Wrong Clubs: Malicious actors could mint players to clubs they don't own, affecting team composition and potentially influencing game outcomes unfairly.
- Disrupted Marketplace Dynamics: Players minted to the wrong clubs could impact market valuations and create confusion or manipulation opportunities.
- Loss of User Confidence and Engagement: Lack of trust in ownership verification can discourage users from actively participating in the game and managing their assets.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case and logs
A possible test case to demonstrate this vulnerability is:

- Alice is the owner of the contract and the game.
- Bob is an unauthorized user who wants to mint players to a wrong club.
- Bob exploits a bug or a malicious owner in the `_footiumClub` contract, and makes the `ownerOf` function return his address for any club ID.
- Bob calls the `mintPlayer` function with a valid club ID, player ID, and proof of minting.
- Bob successfully mints the player to a wrong club.

A possible log with code for this test case is:
```solidity
// Bob exploits a bug or a malicious owner in the _footiumClub contract, and makes the ownerOf function return his address for any club ID
_footiumClub.exploitBugOrMaliciousOwner();

// Bob calls the mintPlayer function with a valid club ID, player ID, and proof of minting
footium.mintPlayer(1, "Bob", [0xabcdef123456789]);

// Bob successfully mints the player to a wrong club
assert(footium.ownerOf(1) == Bob);
```
## Recommendation
A possible recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to use a more secure and reliable way of verifying the club ownership, such as using a mapping or a set to store the club IDs and the owners, and checking the caller’s address against the stored value. This can prevent potential manipulation or compromise of the external contract, and ensure that only the legitimate owners can mint players to their clubs.
```solidity
// Define a mapping to store the club IDs and the owners
mapping(uint256 => address) private _clubOwners;

// Modify the mintPlayer function to use the mapping to verify the club ownership
/**
   * @notice Mint a player.
   * @param clubId The ID of the club to receive the players.
   * @param playerId The ID of the player to be minted.
   * @param mintProof The proof that a certain player can be minted.
   * @dev Only the owner can mint players to their club.
