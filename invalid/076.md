# Recommended to delete the use of CountersUpgradeable::_tokenIdCounter , it has been deleted in the latest OZ library

## Summary
Recommended to delete the use of CountersUpgradeable.Counter, the `CountersUpgradeable `has been deleted in the latest OZ library

## Vulnerability Detail
Accounting this OpenZeppelin fiexd issue
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4233#issuecomment-1567536193

```markdown
because the inner struct members are directly modifiable bypassing the struct interface. Additionally, a Counter being a uint256 value occupies an entire storage slot whereas in most occasions packing a counter in storage with other values will be a far larger optimization than removing overflow checks;
```

the `Counters.sol` contract has been removed , and recommend to use handwrite `++tokenid` method.


## Impact
New announced Solidity features might allow replicating the behavior without the Counters.sol contract (eg. User Defined Types), and a Counter being a uint256 value occupies an entire storage slot , cost more gas consumption

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L61-L71

```solidity
   tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation
use a hand writted counter state varible to store current tokenId
code example
```solidity
    uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;

    function safeMint(address to)
        external
        onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter;
            _safeMint(_receiver, tokenId);
            _tokenIdCounter += 1;
    }

```
