# Players can be minted at no cost

## Summary
Club owners can mint players to their clubs without paying any fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintPlayer` function allows owners to mint certain players to their club. The function is payable and cost of minting is sent to the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract.
However, there's no enforcement on how much can be sent, this allows owners to mint without paying any fee.  
## Impact
Tokens can be minted for free, at no cost, and funds might not be available in the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` to claim.
