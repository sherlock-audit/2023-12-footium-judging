# Potential vulnerability in Merkle Tree Leaf Construction

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`FootiumAcademy.sol` contract's `mintPlayer()` function creates a leaf node by hashing concatenated data (`clubId`, `playerId`, and `msg.value`) using `keccak256`. [OpenZeppelin's documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#MerkleProof) warns that if the pre-hashed data is exactly 64 bytes long, it could be reinterpreted as a sorted pair of internal nodes, leading to potential Merkle tree hash collisions. This could occur if the `playerId` (when encoded) plus 64 bytes (for `clubId` and `msg.value`) equals 64 bytes before hashing.

## Impact
An attacker to generate valid Merkle proofs for unauthorized leaf nodes. This could lead to unauthorized minting of NFTs, compromising the integrity of the `Footium` ecosystem and potentially leading to significant financial losses or reputational damage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the leaf node construction to prevent the pre-hashed data from being exactly 64 bytes.
**Example**:
```solidity
bytes32 leaf = keccak256(
    bytes.concat(
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(clubId, playerId, msg.value, block.number))
    )
);
```
