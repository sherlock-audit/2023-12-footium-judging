# `OwnableUpgradeable` uses single-step ownership transfer

## Summary

`OwnableUpgradeable` implements a simplified process for transferring ownership in a single step.

## Vulnerability Detail

If an incorrect address is provided when transferring ownership or admin rights using the single-step ownership transfer method, the role may be lost permanently. The protocol's implementation of the ownership pattern is in `OwnableUpgradeable.sol`, where a single-step transfer is used. This can be problematic for methods marked as `onlyOwner` throughout the protocol, which includes some core protocol functionalities.
```solidity
        contract ... is
            PausableUpgradeable,
            ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
@>          OwnableUpgradeable
        {
..SNIP..        
            function initialize(
                ...
            ) external initializer {
                __Pausable_init();
                __ReentrancyGuard_init();
@>              __Ownable_init();
..SNIP..           
```

## Impact

All important protocol functionalities will be bricked, and the excessive use of `onlyOwner` leads to an additional lack of security throughout the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use the two-step ownership transfer pattern, which involves transferring ownership to a "pending" state. Only once the new owner claims their new rights, will the old owner's control over the contract be relinquished. It is advised to use OpenZeppelin's [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) contract for this purpose.
