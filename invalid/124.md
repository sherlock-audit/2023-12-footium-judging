# Old data is not transferred if the upgrade of the `FootiumAcademy.sol` is done.

## Summary

`FootiumAcademy.sol` does not implement any function that is responsible for transferring the data to the new implementation. This could lead to permanent loss of information.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no function in the `FootiumAcademy.sol` to transfer data like `FootiumAcademy::_mintedPlayers` to the new implementation. This will lead to loss of information. Engines might not be able to recognize the users and can cause loss to the users.


## Impact

could cause loss to information.
