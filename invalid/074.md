## Summary

The contract allows payments with values less than or equal to zero, resulting in potentially zero or negative payments being accepted.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `makePayment` function, the condition for checking the payment amount is `<= 0`, which allows zero or negative payments to be processed.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to incorrect handling of payment amounts, allowing zero or negative payments to be made to the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Existing code snippet with the issue
if (msg.value <= 0) {
    revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the payment validation condition to strictly check for positive amounts (> 0) to reject zero or negative payments, ensuring that only positive payment amounts are accepted.
