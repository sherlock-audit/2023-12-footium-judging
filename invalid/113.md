# Redundant Balance Check in Withdraw Function (Explicit If Statement + Unnecessary Code)

## Summary
The withdraw function has a redundant balance check, which could be simplified and made more readable.
## Vulnerability Detail
The withdraw function explicitly checks if the balance is greater than 0 before sending anything. This check could be made implicit by directly sending the ownerâ€™s share within the require statement. This would reduce the code complexity and improve the readability of the function.
## Impact
The redundant balance check could result in lower code quality and maintainability for the contract.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case
```solidity
// The contract owner
address owner = 0x1234;
// The contract balance
uint256 balance = 10 ether;
// The withdraw function
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
  uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
  if (balance > 0) {
    (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
    if (!sent) {
      revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
    }
  }
}

```
## Logs
```javascript
Owner calls withdraw()...
Owner receives 10 ether...

```
## Recommendation
```solidity
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
  uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
  // Use require to check the balance and revert with a message if it is zero
  require(balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
  // ...
}

```
