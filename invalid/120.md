# Players are not transferred to new owner if the club is transferred

## Summary
The players will not be transfereed to the new owner if the club is transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The issue lies in the contracts system lacking the implementation of Footium's core defi invariant that `Club owns players`.
- There's no way to verify onchain that this player belongs to this club, except for the images in the URI. Example, the image of a player can have logo of that clu.
- But when a transfer of club happens to a new owner, then the players are not transferred.

## Impact
There's no onchain mappings state between club owner and the players owned by that club

## Recommendation
Implement a system that transfers the ownership of players when club is transferred
