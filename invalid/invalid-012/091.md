# Users can bypass Player royalties by selling clubs as a whole.

## Summary
Players have royalty built in with the help of EIP2981 but clubs do not. This allows bulk sale of players via clubs and royalty fee for the protocol can be bypassed.

Note: This is the not fixed issue from the [previous](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/293) ``Footium contest`` with a ``Will Fix`` label.

## Vulnerability Detail
[FootiumPlayer.sol#L51](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPlayer.sol#L51)

This sets the ``royaltyFeePercentage`` for the ``receiver`` using ``_setDefaultRoyalty()``.

But, [FootiumClub.sol#L14-L20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L14-L20) doesn't inherit ``ERC2981Upgradeable`` and doesn't implement ``_setDefaultRoyalty()``.

## Impact
Royalty fee for the protocol can be bypassed by bulk sale of players via clubs.

## Recommendation
Implement EIP 2981 on clubs too.
