# Merkle leaf values for `claimETHPrize` are 64 bytes before hashing which can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary

`FootiumPirzeDistributor::claimETHPrize(...)` function use 64 bytes values to generate the leaf values for the Merkle hash. This might collide with the internal nodes of the merkle tree.

## Vulnerability Detail

`MerkleProofUpgradeable.sol` puts the following warning at the beginning of the contract:

```solidity
 * WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
 ```
 
 This is how the values are calculated in the function:
 ```solidity
    function claimETHPrize(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes32[] calldata _proof
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the prize receiver is the sender
        if (_to != msg.sender) {
            revert InvalidAccount();
        }

        // Checks the Merkle proof, which is constructed as a hash of
        // the token address, the receiver address and the amount
        // @audit avoid adding the 64 bytes value as a proof
        if (
            !MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                ethMerkleRoot,
@>                keccak256(abi.encode(_to, _amount))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidETHMerkleProof();
        }

        // The amount to be claimed is the difference between the total amount
        // and the amount already claimed.
        // This means that the amount passed in the function call is the total
        // amount that was ever earned by the user.
        uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];

        // If there is still an amount to be claimed, transfer the tokens
        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;

            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(value);
            }
        }

        emit ClaimETH(_to, value);
    }
```
 
 This could allow users to claim the ETH not mean for him to claim.

## Impact

Users can abuse Merkle tree to can claim the ETH not meant for them or this might also lead to make it unclaimable.

## Tool used

- Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a combination of variables that doesn't sum to 64 bytes
