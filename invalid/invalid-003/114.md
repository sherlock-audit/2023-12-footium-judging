# Merkel leaf collision allows to drain FootiumPrizeDistributor

## Summary

The FootiumPrize distributor uses a Merkel tree to ensure rewards are send to the right person.
The leaf of this tree includes the amount and the "to" address. Only the address which will receive the rewards can claim the price.
To get the hash of the leaf, the contract uses abi.encode of these 2 values. This allows for collision of leaf's stated in OZ documentation. 
Now if any user forges a combination of address and price amount, that leads to collision, he can drain the distributor.
This requires him owning the forged addresses private key / be the deployer of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The leaf allows for collision:

```solidity
!MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(
                _proof,
                erc20MerkleRoot,
                keccak256(abi.encode(_token, _to, _amount))
            )
```

The value send is based on the priv. amount of tokens send, in this case 0.

```solidity
        uint256 value = _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to];

```

## Impact

Drain FootiumPrizeDistributor.

It has to be noted that the possibility of this is really low, finding a combination of address, amount and value that allows to drain any amount of tokens should be really unlikely to find, if this happens the impact is high.
