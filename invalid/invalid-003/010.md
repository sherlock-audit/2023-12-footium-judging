# FootiumPrizeDistributor::claimEthPrize 64 bytes leaf may lead to collision with merkle tree internal nodes

## Summary
The function `FootiumPrizeDistributor::claimEthPrize` uses leafs of length 64 bytes for claiming. This means that it is in theory possible to generate a collision of a leaf and an intermediate tree node, and claiming excess funds

## Vulnerability Detail
This is the same vulnerability as has been raised in the initial contest:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium-judging/issues/300

It is worthy to note that the initial version of `claimEthPrize` was not vulnerable to this since `abi.encodePacked` was used, and the bytes length of the encoding was 52 as a result:

Now that `claimEthPrize` uses `abi.encode` with same inputs, the bytes length is 64:

## Impact
In reality a collision is very very highly unlikely (`_to == msg.sender` and `_amount` should be a valid amount), it is still better to avoid using 64 bytes leafs in merkle trees.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please change the leaf structure so it is not 64 bytes.
Either use `abi.encodePacked` as previously or maybe add a padding value to change the length
