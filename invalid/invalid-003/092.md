# Merkle leaf values for FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimETHPrize() are 64 bytes before hashing which can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary

claimETHPrize hashes 64 bytes when calculating leaf allowing it to collide with the internal nodes of the merkle tree.


## Vulnerability Detail

MerkleProofUpgradeable.sol puts the following warning at the beginning of the contract:

[FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/617cbc3df2fb51d9e8e5c701355efec4d4193d55/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L171)

```solidity
 * WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
```
This is problematic because FootiumPrizeDistributor uses `to` and `amount` as the base of the leaf, which are address & uint256 (32 bytes each for 64 bytes total). This allows collision between leaves and internal nodes. These collisions could allow users to double claim the ETH prize.

## Impact
Users can abuse merkle tree collisions to double claim the prize (theft of ether)

## Recommendation
Use a combination of variables that doesn't sum to 64 bytes

example : hash 3 * 32 bytes ==> (block.timestamp, to (address), amount (uint)). Since timestamp can't be manipulated and tx's can t be frontran by arbitrum sequencer.
