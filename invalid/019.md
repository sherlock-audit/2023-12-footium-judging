# No gap for upgradable contracts

## Summary

Protocol have many upgradable contracts without gap.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol have many upgradable contracts that can change their logic in the future they also can have need to add more storage variables but without having implemented storage gap after updating contracts can have storage collusions.

## Impact

For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments" (quote OpenZeppelin). Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts, potentially causing loss of user fund or cause the contract to malfunction completely.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add this line of code to every upgradable contract at the end of the storage variables.

```diff
+ uint256[50] private __gap;
```
