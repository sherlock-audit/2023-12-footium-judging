# ETH prizes can't be transferred if the prize recipient is a contract without a `receive()` and `fallback()`

## Summary
ETH prizes can't be transferred if the recipient is a contract without a `receive()` and `fallback()`

## Vulnerability Detail
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L187C1-L191C10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L187C1-L191C10)

```solidity
file: FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol
// function claimETHPrize
        ...
            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
-->             revert FailedToSendETH(value);
            }
        }
```

As we can see above, ETH prizes can not be transferred to contracts that do not have `receive` or `fallback` functions and there is no way to transfer these prizes to another account.

The function should either wrap the ETH and try to send it that way or should take another argument to transfer funds to another address.

## Impact

- ETH prizes may not be transferred to recipient and locked in the `FootiumPrizeDistributor`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There might be two ways to mitigate this issue.

* The first one is wrapping the ETH and then sending it.
    

```diff
        // If there is still an amount to be claimed, transfer the tokens
        if (value > 0) {
            totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;

            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
-                revert FailedToSendETH(value);
+                // Import IWETH interface and WETH contract address in your chain to Wrap as WETH
+                IWETH(WETH).deposit{ value: value }();
+
+                // Transfer WETH instead
+                IWETH(WETH).transfer(_to, value);
            }
        }
```

* The second option is to take another argument in the `claimETHPrize()` function and transfer the `value` to that address.
