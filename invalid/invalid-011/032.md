# Audit:  Minimum Payment in Ether Verification---Footium General Payment Contract::makePayment

## Summary
`FootiumGeneralPaymentContract::makePayment` has no minimum required amount of ether expected to be sent as payment

## Vulnerability Detail
The `makePayment` function in the smart contract processes payments and requires additional verification to ensure that the transferred Ether matches the expected amount. The current implementation lacks a crucial check on the value of Ether sent during payment transactions.

## Impact
The absence of a condition to verify whether the transferred Ether matches the expected amount leaves the contract susceptible to payment discrepancies. This oversight could lead to unintended consequences.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L84

```javascript

function makePayment(uint256 _clubId, string calldata _message)
        external
        payable
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
        // Require that the sender is the owner of the club
        if (msg.sender != footiumClub.ownerOf(_clubId)) {
            revert NotClubOwner(_clubId, msg.sender);
        }

        // Require that the payment amount is greater than 0
        if (msg.value <= 0) {
            revert IncorrectETHAmount(msg.value);
        }
// @audit Missing check for minimum ETH sent as msg.value required to mint
    // Additional code should be added here to enforce the minimum ETH requirement

        // Send the payment to the payment receiver address
        (bool sent, ) = paymentReceiverAddress.call{value: msg.value}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value);
        }

        emit PaymentMade(_clubId, msg.value, _message);
    }
    
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To enhance the security and reliability of the makePayment function, it is recommended to incorporate a condition to check whether the transferred Ether aligns with the expected payment amount.
