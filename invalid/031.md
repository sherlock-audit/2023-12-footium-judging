# Audit:  Security Review: Front-Running Vulnerability in withdraw Function

## Summary
Security Review: Front-Running Vulnerability in withdraw Function

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could observe a transaction to call the withdraw function, then send a transaction with a higher gas price to call the withdraw function before the original transaction gets mined. The attacker's transaction would then get the balance of the contract, leaving nothing for the original transaction.

## Impact
The `withdraw` function in the smart contract is susceptible to a front-running attack, potentially compromising the security of fund withdrawals.  This vulnerability arises from the lack of protection against adversaries attempting to exploit the time delay between transaction submission and its inclusion in a block.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumAcademy.sol#L144

```solidity
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        if (balance > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(balance);
            }
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement protection mechanisms to prevent front-running attacks during withdrawals.
