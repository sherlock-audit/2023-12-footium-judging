# FootiumPlayer::setRoyaltyInfo Users can front-run setRoyaltyInfo to arbitrage NFT prices

## Summary
Savvy users may front-run setRoyaltyInfo and sell their footium player NFT on secondary at a better price

## Vulnerability Detail
When the royalty increases it can drive the price down on marketplaces due to the end-price for the user being higher. 

### Scenario
Alice is a FootiumPlayer NFT holder, and wants to sell her NFTs at the best price.

Alice front-runs the call to setRoyaltyInfo and sells her NFTs at floor price on the marketplace, driving the price further down. 

## Impact
Sophisticated players will front-run setRoyaltyInfo calls by the owner to sell their NFTs at the best price and drive the floor price down during those events

## Recommendation
Create some kind of timelock before calling setRoyaltyInfo, during which the tokens are not available to be traded (paused)
