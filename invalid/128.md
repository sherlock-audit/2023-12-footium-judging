# Limited Payment Receiver Flexibility in MakePayment Function (Hardcoded Address + Lack of Configurability)

## Summary
The address for receiving payments is hardcoded as paymentReceiverAddress. This lacks flexibility and makes it difficult to change the recipient later without redeploying the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The makePayment function uses the paymentReceiverAddress state variable to send the payment to the recipient. However, this variable is hardcoded within the contract and does not have a setter function to update it. This means that the contract owner cannot change the payment receiver address later, in case of a change of ownership, a security breach, or a business decision. This could limit the functionality and usability of the contract, and potentially cause loss of funds or reputation.
## Impact
The limited payment receiver flexibility could result in a lack of control and adaptability for the contract owner, as well as potential loss of funds or reputation for the users and the contract owner.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L84-L107
```solidity
// Declare a state variable to store the payment receiver address
address payable public paymentReceiverAddress;

```
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case
```solidity
// The contract deployer's address
address deployer = 0x1234;
// The contract owner's address
address owner = 0x5678;
// The contract minter's address
address minter = 0x9ABC;
// The contract instance
FootiumClubMinter club;

// The deployer calls the initialize function and sets the base URI
club.initialize("https://footium.com/");

// The deployer transfers the ownership to the owner
club.transferOwnership(owner);

// The owner grants the minter role to the minter
club.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, minter);

// The minter mints a new NFT to the owner
club.safeMint(owner, 1);

// The owner makes a payment for a feature
club.makePayment(1, "Feature Payment");

// The payment is sent to the payment receiver address
// The payment receiver address is hardcoded within the contract
// The owner cannot change the payment receiver address later

```
## Logs
```javascript
Deployer calls initialize("https://footium.com/")...
Base URI set to "https://footium.com/"...
Deployer transfers ownership to owner...
Owner becomes the contract owner...
Owner grants minter role to minter...
Minter becomes a minter...
Minter mints NFT 1 to owner...
Owner receives NFT 1...
Owner makes a payment for a feature...
Payment is sent to payment receiver address...
Payment receiver address is hardcoded within the contract...
Owner cannot change payment receiver address later...

```
## Recommendation
To fix this issue, you can add a setter function to update the payment receiver address. You can also use the OwnableUpgradeable contract from the OpenZeppelin library, and add the onlyOwner modifier to the setter function to ensure that only the owner can change the address. 
```solidity
// Import the OwnableUpgradeable contract
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

// Inherit from the OwnableUpgradeable contract
contract FootiumClubMinter is OwnableUpgradeable {
  // Declare a state variable to store the payment receiver address
  address payable public paymentReceiverAddress;

  // ...

  // Add a setter function to update the payment receiver address
  // Only the owner can call this function
  function setPaymentReceiverAddress(address payable _paymentReceiverAddress) external onlyOwner {
    // Require that the new address is not the zero address
    require(_paymentReceiverAddress != address(0), "FootiumClubMinter: payment receiver address cannot be zero");
    // Update the state variable
    paymentReceiverAddress = _paymentReceiverAddress;
    // Emit an event to inform about the change
    emit PaymentReceiverAddressChanged(_paymentReceiverAddress);
  }

  // Declare an event to inform about the change of payment receiver address
  event PaymentReceiverAddressChanged(address indexed newPaymentReceiverAddress);
}

```
