# Missing payable keyword on addresses that are supposed to receive ETH will revert some functions with `FailedToSendETH()` error

## Summary
The `_prizeDistributorAddress`, as well as other addresses that will be receiving ETH needs to have the payable keyword to be able to receive ETH but they don't.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_prizeDistributorAddress` lacks the payable keyword so it won't be able to receive ETH.

```solidity
 // forward total fee to the prize distributor contract
        (bool sent, ) = _prizeDistributorAddress.call{value: msg.value}(""); //@audit-issue no payable keyword on _prizeDistributorAddress
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value);
        }
```

The `paymentReceiverAddress` lacks the payable keyword so it won't be able to receive ETH.

```solidity
        (bool sent, ) = paymentReceiverAddress.call{value: msg.value}("");
        if (!sent) {
            revert FailedToSendETH(msg.value);
        }
```

The `_to` param here in FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimETHPrize() also lacks the payable keyword, so it won't be able to receive ETH
```solidity
            (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
            if (!sent) {
                revert FailedToSendETH(value);
            }
        }
```

## Impact
FootiumAcademy.mintPlayer(), FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.makePayment() and FootiumPrizeDistributor.claimETHPrize() will always revert with error FailedToSendETH(msg.value) whenever the msg.value is > 0 when calling the functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the payable keyword to `_prizeDistributorAddress`, `paymentReceiverAddress` and   `_to` param, so that they will be able to receive ETH.
