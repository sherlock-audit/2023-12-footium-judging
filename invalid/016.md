# The transfer of ERC20 prizes may fail without reverting and result in the funds locking.

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens do not revert when a transaction fails, resulting in users' funds being locked and inaccessible to them.

## Vulnerability Detail
Because some ERC20 tokens don't revert or return 0 when transfer is failed, the `claimERC20Prize()` function can have unpredictable behavior or cause fund loss.

But the `claimERC20Prize()` function doesn't check if the token transfer was successful. This cause if a transfer fails, the ERC20 tokens will still be marked as claimed from the `FootiumPrizeDistributor` contract, even though the user didn't receive them.

## Impact
This causes the funds of user to be locked and made inaccessible to them.

## Code Snippet
[FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L139-L144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L139-L144)
```solidity
        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            _token.safeTransfer(_to, value);
        }

        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
```
## Tool used
Visual Studio Code, Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransfer()` from OpenZeppelin's [SafeERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20) to transfer ERC20 tokens.
