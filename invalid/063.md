# front-running vulnerability in Merkle proofs

---
name: Front-running Vulnerability
about: regarding front-running vulnerability in Merkle proofs
title: "Front-running Vulnerability"
labels: "Vulnerability, Merkle Tree"
assignees: ""
---

## Summary
Lack of protection against front-running attacks on Merkle proofs.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows direct verification of Merkle proofs without implementing measures to prevent front-running attacks. This exposes the protocol to potential manipulations of proofs before publication.
## Impact
Possible exploitation by malicious actors to manipulate Merkle proofs and affect the fairness of the protocol, potentially leading to an unfair distribution of rewards.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Example implementation (not exhaustive)
uint256 public constant proofSubmissionDelay = 10 minutes;

function claimERC20Prize(
    // ... existing parameters ...
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Ensure the proof submission is after a delay
    require(block.timestamp >= proofSubmissionDelay, "Proof submission delay not met");

    // ... existing code ...
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement strategies to mitigate front-running by either timestamping or using mechanisms to delay execution of proof verification until a certain block is reached.
