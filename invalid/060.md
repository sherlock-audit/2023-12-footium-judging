## Summary
The academy contract's mintPlayer function lacks comprehensive error handling, leading to potential confusion for users during transaction failures.
## Vulnerability Detail
Insufficient error messages and checks in the mintPlayer function may result in unclear reasons for transaction failures, impacting user experience and contract transparency.

## Impact
Unclear error messages could lead to user frustration or misunderstandings regarding transaction failures, potentially affecting user trust and adoption.

## Code Snippet
```solidity

function mintPlayer(
    //...existing parameters...
) external payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    //...existing code...

    // Example of incomplete error handling:
    if (msg.sender != _footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId)) {
        revert NotClubOwner(clubId, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
