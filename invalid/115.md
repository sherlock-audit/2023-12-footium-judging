# Missing Initialization Protection in Initialize Function (Unrestricted Access + State Manipulation).

## Summary
The contract does not have a constructor, but instead uses an initialize function to set up the initial state. This is a common pattern for upgradeable contracts, but it also introduces some risks. For example, anyone can call the initialize function before the owner does, and set the base URI to an arbitrary value.
## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize function is used to set up the initial state of the contract, such as the name, symbol, base URI, and roles. However, this function does not have any modifier or check to ensure that it can only be called once, or only by the owner. This means that anyone can call the initialize function before the owner does, and set the base URI to an arbitrary value. This could affect the metadata and image of the NFTs, and compromise the integrity and usability of the contract.
## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the state of the contract, and potentially cause confusion, misinformation, or loss of value for the users.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumClub.sol#L31-L40
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Test case
```solidity
// The attacker's address
address attacker = 0x1234;
// The owner's address
address owner = 0x5678;
// The contract instance
FootiumClub club;

// The attacker calls the initialize function before the owner does
club.initialize("https://malicious.com/");

// The owner calls the initialize function after the attacker does
club.initialize("https://footium.com/");

// The initialize function does not revert or check the caller's address
// The base URI is set to the attacker's value

```
## Logs
```javascript
Attacker calls initialize("https://malicious.com/")...
Base URI set to "https://malicious.com/"...
Owner calls initialize("https://footium.com/")...
Base URI remains "https://malicious.com/"...

```
## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the initializer modifier from the @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol library. This modifier ensures that the function can only be called once, and that the caller is the owner of the contract.
```solidity
// Import the Initializable library
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

// ...

function initialize(string memory baseURI) external initializer {
  // Use the initializer modifier to protect the function
  __ERC721_init("FootiumClub", "FFC");
  __AccessControl_init();
  __Pausable_init();
  __ReentrancyGuard_init();
  __Ownable_init();

  _base = baseURI;
  _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}

```
