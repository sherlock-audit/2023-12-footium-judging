# Players minted by `FootiumClubMinter.sol` are not tied to any playerId, only tied to the NFT's tokenId

## Summary
Player NFT's that are minted in bulk whenever a club is minted are not tied to a playerId.

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen in `FootiumAcademy::mintPlayer`, each player minted has it's tokenId linked to a playerId.

According to the protocol developer, this link between tokenId and playerId is an intended invariant of the protocol.

Me: Hi, do you intend all of the players to have their assetId linked to a certain playerId? would that be considered an invariant?

Dev: Yes, that is correct.

        require(MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify(mintProof, _merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof"); 

        uint256 playerAssetId = _footiumPlayer.safeMint(_footiumClub.ownerOf(clubId));

        _mintedPlayers[playerId] = true;

--->  emit AcademyPlayerMinted(clubId, playerAssetId, playerId, msg.value); 
       // through the above event, playerId is linked to playerAssetId
    }

 However the players minted in `FootiumClubMinter::mint` to a new club are not linked to any playerId, breaking the invariant.
 (Note that while the variable `playerId` is (confusingly) used, it is used to represent the asset's tokenId)

            emit InitialPlayerMinted(tokenId, i, playerId, to); 
--->     // the above playerId is technically the playerAssetId. not the same as playerId used in `FootiumAcademy::mintPlayer`
            // @audit - So then what about the playerId in the off-chain sense? We don't seem to be using any here.

## Impact

Since these 20 players are not linked to any playerId, it can potentially cause problems with off-chain tracking of the players. This is especially important since the off-chain tracking of transactions is crucial to this specific protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a default playerId to link to the 20 players who are minted whenever a club is minted.
