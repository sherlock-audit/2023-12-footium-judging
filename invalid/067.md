## Summary

The contract includes an initialize() function for initialization purposes, but it lacks specific parameters or any functional setup code. This function seems redundant within this contract's context.

## Vulnerability Detail

The initialize() function lacks any actual initialization actions, potentially leading to confusion or misunderstanding among users or developers expecting some form of initialization logic.

## Impact

While it doesn’t directly threaten security, the presence of this function might create confusion regarding its intended functionality. It could be seen as redundant without providing any actual utility.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Initializes the Footium Token contract.
 */
function initialize() external initializer {
    __ERC20_init("Footium Token", "FOOT");

    __Ownable_init();
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the initialize() function if it doesn’t serve a specific purpose for initialization. If intended for future updates or additional functionalities, document its purpose clearly for transparency.
