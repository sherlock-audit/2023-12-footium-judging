# Making players freely transferrable might cause malicious behavior during competitions

## Summary
Players are transferrable between any addresses/clubs at any time, this logic exposes a vulnerability for malicious user to transfer players between several teams and allow them run for several teams.

## Vulnerability Detail
FootinumPlayer contract allows player NFTS to be transferred any time without any restrictions.
Abusing this feature, some malicious users would let players run for several teams, or even more:
1. They can buy a set of highly-skilled(expensive) players from the market.
2. Let them run for several of the teams they create, transferring players between football matches.
3. Earn more awards and rewards more than they deserve, both on off-chain and on-chain(through `FootinumPrizeDistributor`). Technically they can make their teams take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... in the Leagues games or Tournaments and at the end they will have more rewards allocated from `FootinumPrizeDistributor`.

## Impact
Malicious club managers can have them more rewards allocated than they deserve by utilizing a set of highly-skilled players between several teams.

## Code Snippets
FootinumPlayer contract just inherits from ERC721Upgradeable and does not override any transfer-related functions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There can be different mitigations applied based on the strategy:
1. Set-up a flag controllable by owner, to enable/disable transferring players. (Only enable during transfer window)
2. Apply time-lock for player transfers so that there will be cooldown time between transfers.
