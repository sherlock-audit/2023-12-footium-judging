# FootiumAcademy::mintPlayer A user can honeypot another user in the context of a club sale

## Summary
A malicious user can use a sale of a club to honeypot another unsuspecting user during the sale on a secondary market.
The malicious user would sell the FootiumClub NFT with unclaimed playerIds, but would front-run the sale transaction to claim the players thus rugging the buyer.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious club seller Alice can honeypot an unsuspecting buyer Bob, following the scenario outlined below

### Scenario

- Alice sells her club of Id 1234, with unclaimed player 1111, factoring in the price of the player in the sell offer
- Bob takes the offer to buy the club, since it also enables to buy the player 1111 and bypass the EIP-2981 royalties
- Alice sees Bob transaction in the mempool, front-runs claiming the player 1111
- Bob is rugged because he bought the club 1234 at an inflated price

## Impact
Some buyers may get rugged by buying clubs at an inflated price on secondary.

## Recommendation
Maybe consider implementing a timelock feature, blocking all actions relative to a club before a sale, to protect the buyer.
