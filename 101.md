# Unclaimed ETH/ARB can become permanently locked within the `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` contract.

## Summary
Smart contracts that do not implement the receive/fallback function are unable to claim ETH/ARB (Native token) from the `FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol` contract. Consequently, unclaimed ETH/ARB may become permanently locked, rendering it irretrievable.
## Vulnerability Detail
FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol facilitates the claiming of ERC20 tokens and native tokens by whitelisted users/contracts. The contract allocates a specific amount of ERC20/native tokens for the whitelisted entities, who can claim their tokens by providing a valid Merkle proof.

To claim native tokens from the contract, users/contracts are required to invoke the `claimETHPrize()` function. The contract utilizes `(bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");` to execute the transfer of native tokens. However, if the `_to` address corresponds to a contract that does not implement the receive/fallback function, the execution will revert. Consequently, unclaimed native tokens will remain locked within the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract indefinitely, with no mechanism available to recover these inaccessible tokens.
## Impact
Native tokens may become permanently locked within the FootiumPrizeDistributor contract, and their retrieval is not possible.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the attempt to send native tokens fails using the call() method, it is recommended to wrap the native tokens and transfer them in the form of a wrapped version, such as WETH.
