# If the owner change the merkleRoot in FootiumPrizeDistributor all funds hat are saved in the root will vanish

## Summary
IF the owner change the merkleRoot in FootiumPrizeDistributor all funds hat are saved in the root will vanish

## Vulnerability Detail
If the erc20MerkleRoot is changed by the contract owner using the setERC20MerkleRoot function, the claimERC20Prize function will only work for new proofs that match the new erc20MerkleRoot. Any proofs that were valid for the old merkle root will no longer be valid, and claims using those proofs will fail with the InvalidERC20MerkleProof error.

This corresponds and for the EthMerkleRoot

it("if the owner change the merkleRoot users cannot take their prize", async () => {
const leaf = hashERC20PrizeInputs([
token.address,
addr1.address,
INITIAL_AMOUNT
]);
const proof = erc20MerkleTree.getHexProof(leaf);

        const newRoot = getRandomBytes32();
        console.log(erc20MerkleTree, "<- first time")
        await expect(distributor.setERC20MerkleRoot(newRoot))
            .to.emit(distributor, "SetERC20MerkleRoot")
            .withArgs(newRoot);

        await distributor.setERC20MerkleRoot(erc20MerkleTree.getHexRoot());

        console.log(erc20MerkleTree, "<- second time")

        await expect(
            distributor
                .connect(addr1)
                .claimERC20Prize(
                    addr1.address,
                    token.address,
                    INITIAL_AMOUNT,
                    proof
                )
        )
            .to.emit(distributor, "ClaimERC20")
            .withArgs(token.address, addr1.address, INITIAL_AMOUNT);
    });
## Impact

## Recommendation
While updating the merkleRoot, ensure that there is no valid proofs anymore, or the owner can transfer the proofs to the new merkleroot
